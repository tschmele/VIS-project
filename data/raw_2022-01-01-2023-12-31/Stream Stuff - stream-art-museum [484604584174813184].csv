The term ""information overload"" was first used as early as 1962 by scholars in management and information studies, including in Bertram Gross' 1964 book, The Managing of Organizations,[7][8] and was further popularized by Alvin Toffler in his bestselling 1970 book Future Shock.[9] Speier et al.

While I have your attention, you have at least a passing familiarity with the pi√±ata, right? You know, a little papier-m√¢ch√© creature that is commonly found at birthday parties, where blindfolded children are disoriented then unleashed with blunt weaponry in an attempt to free sweet treats from the creature's innards? ""Dale, dale, dale, no pierdas el tino"" and all that. THAT pi√±ata. Maybe you've never had the chance to be a wildly swinging kid or a parent sitting in a tree, wildly pulling on the rope that suspends the pi√±ata, but you've seen one, somewhere. You're AWARE of pi√±atas as a concept. Ok, cool. So now that you have probably said the word pi√±ata out loud several times, congratulations! I doubt you said it as pin-i-ata, because you understand that would be silly, of course. You pronounced the √± sound as one syllable, in accordance with its single character. You now know what a certain twitch mod named nyahgust meant when they said the ny sound was one syllable (think √±-august). You wouldn't expect a phonetics lesson in your Joesph Anderson stream art, but it might just be what you *get*.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/484604584174813184/1129263005528506398/the_last_chan_i_want_to_forget.png?ex=6697ec61&is=66969ae1&hm=91a9ef25362528a821dc5d3a50441a605a9585a07935c97c256b13d419d698cf&","pogjom (41),HeinzGate (10),üçë (16),Valle (10),pog (5),jphFai (10),JoePoint (7),üëÖ (4)"

Seriously, more than a year ago I joined the community and during that period I was thinking about making some drawings to commemorate some of my favorite streams of 2022 but I didn't have the time to finish them. Thanks to Latty for motivating me by presenting me with the JASB cards! As most of the drawings I already made fit perfectly in the new banner. 

 I took a break to make a few designs, a few terrible jokes and well here we are. It varied a bit from the current format so please don't expect the cards to look like this if they are ever imported to page, I just have so much fun with them c;

""Preemptive fanart for Alan Wake I guess? Storywise takes place after Anderson's farm (oh... I think I missed another idea for joke there), so maybe kinda spoiler-ish? Nothing major though and the game is like from 2010 but you do you. Also the whole first fanart attempt was a disaster from the start. I have some art background, bought a cheap tablet on a whim long time ago and tried it once or twice, nothing big, decided that ""This  time for sure!"", failed miserably, everything is hard and clunky to me and uncomfortable, dropped the idea and decided to stick with the old ways. Massive respect to everyone who draws digital. Also I found this Witcher 3 logo and thought it looks like an S, so there, I hope the joke works.""

Its original concept, impeccable pacing, and masterfully foreshadowed narrative deserve to be celebrated. The game comes together into a wholly idiosyncratic experience through its many distinct and memorable characters that all feel like they belong in the world; multiple intersecting plotlines that return and resolve in surprising ways; and an ever-increasing list of mysteries that the game manages to wrap up in the end. It balances light-hearted moments with an impressive emotional core for its characters. And it does all that in a dozen hours. However, Ghost Trick's narrative isn't just a satisfying story that is enjoyable as a traditional mystery; it's a cohesive work that works best as an interactive experience. Both the gameplay and story are constrained by the same rules that govern Ghost Trick's universe, ensuring that both aspects are tightly interwoven and mutually beneficial. Both gameplay and story are further expertly realized through the game's presentational style. The deliberate theatrical perspective mimics the sensation of sitting in an audience and looking into the world that is unfolding on stage, as if we are an outside force looking into the world of the living. This theatrical perspective is effectively used to allow the characters to flourish on screen, while simultaneously building suspense, and ingeniously obscuring the mystery right in front of our eyes. Going back and seeing all the immaculate foreshadowing you inevitably missed your first time through makes this a story that you can appreciate even more on a second playthrough. I was very happy to see that the story still held up as a one-of-a-kind narrative that doesn't outstay its welcome after all these years; a story - its soul revived over a decade later - which continues to change the fates of those that cross paths with it.""","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/484604584174813184/1182059734929518662/GT_JADSEYA.png?ex=66982cea&is=6696db6a&hm=e44a33760bd6744ec9bc5bc4e6001459e3e6d9c76e284e2fd5dc654da92f325f&","pog (21),HeinzGate (24),JoeMix (10)"

I don't have strong preferences for any games from JADSEYA'23, BUT..... I would like to propose a pre-emptive candidate for JADSEYA'24 instead - ***Warframe***
- it has the thing Joe loves in movement in games - the ultimate ""fidget to go faster"" technique - Bullet Jump, in addition to parkour, sliding & rolling to go even faster
- also, the game is liked by some prominent members of our community, e.g. Marik, with his WF chan-art you would finally be able to understand & Eva (the Forspoken Fan) who at some point had been an official Warframe content creation partner
