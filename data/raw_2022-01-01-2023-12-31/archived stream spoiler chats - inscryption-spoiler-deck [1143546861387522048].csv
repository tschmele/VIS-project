You're not a whistleblower exposing a dictatorial regime, you're a random chatter getting angry about being deprived of a privilege that's not owed to you in any way whatsoever. You're whining and you're calling for people to challenge an authority which is *actually way more invested in Joe's experience being high quality than you are.* Regardless of the extra timeouts, they are maintaining chat quality. That is the most important thing for them to do. 

Now don't get me wrong, there is a time for you to voice your opinions on moderation. When new mods are being added, or when Joe is interacting with chat or literally asking for your opinion. None of that is happening. You're not talking *to* anyone, you're just antagonising mods for no purpose. You're not a hero. You're annoying. Stfu.","","tooreal (7),blobno (7),HeinzGate (8)"
