So my meaning is that when they fail at guiding you you will end up misunderstanding things or getting stuck or ruining some ""aha"" moments. One such example is accidentally dying at the fire, or accidentally leaving your lamp behind.

So yes, I think if you break the sequence (unintentionally) then you will have a slightly inferior experience overall. There is no solution to this problem, making it completely linear ruins the feeling of discovery.","","👍 (1)"
