As much as I love it for being the first roguelike that I actually enjoyed, it's a very limited game in comparison to the other two in which the variance between runs is quite low. When you play Nuclear Throne, there isn't really anything particularly insane that you'll be able to do unless you choose specific characters (like Eyes) and get very specific mutations (Throne Butt and Euphoria) OR you make it far enough into a run to get your Ultra mutation. That's not to say that it's a bad game by any means, only that it is lacking in complexity and that ""explosive factor"" that the other two have the potential to give.

Slay The Spire has really grabbed my attention recently, but to be perfectly honest it can be a *very* disheartening and confusing game. When a run goes well in Slay The Spire, it is downright *euphoric.* Getting the stars to align and being able to get the perfect deck and relic combos, however, is as reliable as astrology. You not only need and immense amount of game knowledge to be consistently successful, but you need a *heavy* helping of luck to get cards that you actually know how to synergize together as well. Someone like Kay (who has a MASSIVE brain full of WICKED STS knowledge) can probably make any build or any run successful at my level, but for someone like me there can be a lot of moments where I just feel hopeless and kind of have to prolong that feeling until I actually lose.

Risk of Rain 2 is probably my favorite of the three, though I will admit that a large part of that influence is just due to the visuals of the game. My tastes are obvious, and RoR2 panders to them *perfectly.* I've said many times before that I will often play a game just because I like how I'm able to look in it, and RoR2 is no exception. That aside, it's just a fun, flashy game where everything *feels* right as soon as you start playing. Runs are RNG reliant to be explosive, but you never feel completely-","",""

My only real complaint with RoR2 is that runs tend to be *quite* long - at least twice as long as a standard run in Nuclear Throne or Slay the Spire. It's a *huge* timesink in comparison, but I think the raw fun of the gamefeel helps to make losses feel less staggering whenever they inevitably *do* happen. Combine that with an unlock system which consistently gives you multiple goals outside of just winning the run, and it's the perfect recipe for player retention and positivity for me.","",""

- Nuclear Throne is fun but comparatively simple. Runs aren't nearly as explosive or varied as the other two, but the fast pace and clear goals provided by the simplistic variance makes it a great ""pick up and play"" kind of roguelike.
- Slay The Spire is the intellectual's roguelike, and I'm merely a student. It is consistently confusing to me even during runs where I succeed, and this confusion can lead to a lot of hopelessness when a run that feels like it was going well ends up failing. On the rare run where I *do* have a solid gameplan and RNG blesses me, the experience is *maddeningly* fun, but the lack of consistency and the level of knowledge required can be a huge barrier to that fun.
- Risk of Rain 2 just looks and feels perfect to me. It has just enough complexity to make each run varied and fun, just enough simplicity to make every run feel like it has a clear goal, and just enough to do where even failed runs can feel rewarding. My only complaint is that sometimes I don't wanna spend upwards of an hour on every run that actually goes well.","",""

Since I never posted the update on the Run Idea Ice Ninja suggested, (3 Science Mechs) I figured I'd do that now:
||Full Control based team, entirely focused on Positioning Tricks to get enemies to kill each other. (I call them Team Vek-orosiha in reference to the Danganronpa 2 OST.) Very interesting and challenging team to play, I'm gonna have to do some really tricky positioning to get them to work.||
Also that customized pilot has a funny story behind it:
I wanted to make a team with my 3 (Male) Friends as the Pilots. Rolled a Dice to decide who the Team Leader was, and rolled dice to decide which Time Traveler they were. Landed on a Female Time Traveler, and went ""Okay, well uh, hey X, tell me what your alternate universe female self's name is."" 
Start the Run, and the other two Pilots it gives me are both female. <:Snicker:1139383202696413214>
