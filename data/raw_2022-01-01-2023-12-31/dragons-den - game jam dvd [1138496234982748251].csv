This thread is the place to discuss and share before, during, and after the game jam proper.

Feel free to **organize teams** of up to 4 in here! Discuss your skills and game design sensibilities! Make sure that you will properly be able to work together during the week of the jam - we are a global discord, after all!
(Please DM me to let me know what times your team wants to work with so we can properly communicate with you)

During the jam, feel free to post updates, ask questions, or playtest builds! For people who skimmed the timestamps, this will be a **weeklong jam**, so keep that in mind.
(Games will be submitted through an itch.io page. I will put it up as we get closer to the date of the event. Someone on your team will need an itch.io account.)

Feel free to ping me (<@218810384344154113>) here with any questions or concerns you may have about the jam! I hope this can be an edifying experience for those who feel uncertain of their abilities, and a chance to flex a bit for those who really want to sweat for some marbles‚Ñ¢.
Ultimately, I hope it's fun for everyone who participates and for everyone in the community who will get to see some cool games!","",""

- We'll be using **Unity**
- We're looking for **artists, animation/sound effects** people
- I'm in **CET** time zone.
- Bonus if you can use **Github**
- Game genre is obviously undecided, but it will probably lean into action/ exploration rather than puzzle/ visual novel.

Ideally the team would need at least one artist since we already have someone who can take care of gameplay programming but everyone is welcome! 
We're planning on using gamemaker but obviously nothing is set in stone.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of what I can offer :
- 4+ years of professional experience in the industry with multiple games shipped from indie to AA üë®‚Äçüíº 
- Already did several game jams so I'm used to the pace and production aspects, I can easily take on a producing role to organize efficiently (asset list, quantity sheet, etc) 
Basically I can take care of the boring organization stuff while you do the stuff you enjoy!
- I have experience working on : gameplay, gamefeel, narrative design, pacing, ux/ui, level design, 3Cs, and most other design related stuff üéÆ 
- I can make  ‚ú® üåà***pretty powerpoints and excel sheets***üåà ‚ú®

If you weren't planning on doing so already, I **heavily** suggest making a build of your game a day ahead of the final deadline. Run it on a computer that wasn't used to develop it (if at all possible) to see if unexpected things happen. Keep it as a backup in case something happens outside of your control so you at least have *something* to submit. Consider starting to put together the itch page for your project. Uploads on itch pages shouldn't lock until the final submission deadline.

I hope your games are coming along well - even if they aren't exactly as you might have imagined them at the beginning of the week! I have been personally enjoying seeing all the sneak peeks here and there, and I can't wait to actually play them! Good luck to all the teams, and please make sure to take care of yourselves even through this last leg of the jam!","",""

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3‚Äù03‚Äô tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they‚Äôre large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more ||","",""

It all started at the end of JomsQuest III during a climactic battle with the Shadowbane, it became clear that the ancient prophecy was intricately linked to the entity's defeat. The prophecy hinted at the importance of the chosen one embracing their masculine side to unlock their full potential.
