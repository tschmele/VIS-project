The most succinct explanation I could give is that it's an exploration/survival game. It has a metroidvania-ish world map, but the map is not gated by item progression - it's almost completely open and the only areas that are gated off you can still get around in very flexible ways. The other core of the game is, like I said, survival, and involves a simulation of wildlife, with you near the bottom of the food chain. Getting skilled at the game involves learning risk management, ways of interacting with other creatures, knowing when to stay away or flee, and knowing when to potentially engage in combat (which is very deadly for either side and almost always consists of one side or the other trying to get in one lethal hit)","",""

Greetings everyone. First of all, allow me to apologize for the ping. These are desperate times, and I am being driven to desperate measures. Let me explain. 

You‚Äôve all been tagged because you‚Äôve publicly expressed support for CrossCode in recent days. I recognize that this does not constitute consent for indiscriminate pings, and for that I again apologize. I am an ambassador of Rain World Gang and I come to you with a petition. I hope I'm not pushing too far in doing this - all I expect and hope for is that you listen in good faith.   

Earlier today, Joe confirmed that CrossCode is at the very bottom of the rankings. Moreover, he implied that after a certain game in the lower half of the rankings there‚Äôs a steep drop in votes. All this is to say that it seems very unlikely that CrossCode is going to be winning this category. Now, you could of course take this as an impetus to campaign even harder for CrossCode, and I would respect that. But if we‚Äôre honest with ourselves ‚Äì it seems like it‚Äôs by far the most unpopular pick, and it‚Äôs for a fairly understandable reason when you think about it: Joe has already played CrossCode, which makes the prospect of it winning unappealing to many.","","HeinzGate (6)"
"184713642938204160","baaaldur","2023-11-28T19:45:09.4140000+00:00","Here comes my petition. I want to encourage you all to join forces with other indies and strengthen their support against Big Weeb, since - to put it bluntly - CrossCode is probably a lost cause. I am, of course, selfishly motivated in this. My chosen game, Rain World, is an indie game, and a rather niche one at that. I would, of course, be very happy if you threw your lot in with me and the rest of Rain World gang‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd also be satisfied if you supported other indies, like Fear and Hunger, and hell, even Pathologic (even though it‚Äôs currently in the lead by a ‚Äúhealthy margin‚Äù). I primarily don‚Äôt want to see Big Weeb win. Joe has already played three AA games and is planning to play three more. He‚Äôs already played XBC2. This is a chance to make him play something a bit more novel, a bit more interesting. 

In any case, I think it‚Äôs worth thinking about. If you‚Äôre skeptical about Rain World, I can try to sell you on it. Or, if you already have a designated second choice, you can go with that. Or, of course, you could remain a steadfast CrossCode Crusader ‚Äì I respect holding to one‚Äôs principles. But if the Rain Train sounds appealing, well‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd be happy to have you on board.","","HeinzGate (6)"

My main problem with these Rain world INTERNET WARRIORS. if that they EXPECT Rain World to win, in their mind it has ALREADY won the competition. We're the ENEMY, the OBJECTS in their path to success, they do not even see us as human. They see us as insects, road blocks, barriers who were placed on earth by god to stop their inevitable march of progress. What we stand for does not matter,  all that matters in their eyes if that we're part of the ""other"", the ""outsiders"" to their utopian vision of JADSEYA. I am just a humble follower, I did not set out on a quest to destroy them: I just do not think Rain World is good, but does that matter to them? No, I am a parasite in their eyes, something in which the only solution should be total extermination. Frankly, I am ashamed that the mods have let this culture prosper and flow with not even polite telling off. I have even seen some mods give their BLESSING to these aggressive thugs, gleefully bouncing along as they knee cap yet another Cross Code fan(they're so young and so few). I am sorry if this upsets people and that it came out of such a left field but I cannot stand by any longer as I watch my fellow citizens be squashed under, and let us not mince words here, fascist tyranny","","HeinzGate (2)"

Rain World has a strong fanbase and people love it, but when people express that love it should be BANNED? To the JADSers I ask ""is this the community we wish to cultivate?"" one in which expressing your opinion is considered something banworthy. Once we start banning rain world fans, you're all on the table and that is a FACT. Some would claim that rain world fans are dangerous but quite the opposite is true, I myself have had messages censored by pro crosscodes mods. Some would have you believe that rain world fans are trying to destroy their opponents, not so, we simply believe that there should be hope in the future, that all games which have great effort put in should receive their just reward and be played by joe. there is a simple fact that all JADSers must face and that is that the only just outcome is a win for Rain World. To those who would vote for Fear and Hunger, I would simply ask ""Why?"" we all know that it has received much time in the spotlight, deservedly so, but still, we must extend the same courtesy to all games, when in our power to do so. my fellow JADSers I come to you now pleading to vote for Rain World not because it is easy but because it is right.","","üó£Ô∏è (1),jphGate (2),üìå (1)"

It's a really unique and experiential game that's best played blind and RW gang would try to petition Joe to play it without chat. Its mechanics and systems are really unique and the gameplay is very emergent so there are a lot of opportunities for self imposed challenges or fun joements. RW also has really really cool moments of spectacle (maybe not the right word - but storytelling through environment and like, gameplay moments. You'll see). 

As for whether it picks up - I'd say the opening is the biggest hurdle for a lot of players. Joe has already somewhat bounced off it once, but has also said he's interested in going back go it. I think if you manage to vibe with it and drop any prejudices or expectations you had going in (and I think the commitment that comes with streaming it will help with that) the game immediately starts picking up a lot because you'll get into the groove of adapting to the world. 

I've also just seen a number of streamers play through RW and its been a pleasant experience each time they actually manage to stick with it instead of them just playing it once as a one off thing. And I think it'll also be a nice change of pace for Joe to stream a game where the fun moments arent just reactive or related to chat banter but actually a result of his own playstyle and emergent moments in the game world.

I won't say it's a *guaranteed* cream series, but it'll be novel, and interesting, and it'll expose more people to a sort of game I think the industry desperately needs more of. But peoples tastes differ - some people didnt like the HL2 streams, for example, which were heavy on self imposed gameplay challenges, and instead want a more story heavy game for Joe to react to (whereas I loved those streams). So yeah idk a very rambly response but its the best I can manage from my phone in bed <:pupper:318166088863055872>","","üî• (4)"

CrossCode: Joe already played (will make for mid streams), losing the vote badly, lost cause

Talos Principle: losing the vote, lost cause

SH3-4: Joe is ambivalent about SH, will be a bad time for everyone involved, no one is voting it

KH: Joe's played it, Joe himself thinks it would make for miserable streams

GAA: AA fans already have 6 games locked in, give someone else a seat at the table

Fear and Hunger: RPGMaker game, infuriatingly difficult, hard to stream due to really explicit content

Xenoblade: Joe's already played a Xeno game, it's really really long and there will be lots of boring downtime, XBC1 wont be as batshit or funny

Pathologic: Deliberately miserable games to play, does not gel very well with streams, will be lots of downtime","","üî• (4)"

I think that the Outer Wilds angle isn't a very good one, because the games are not even remotely alike. The connection is that they are both unique experiences (which is rare in gaming now a days), so I understand the comparison. It just seems misleading, and without the context most people won't actually understand why the comparison to OW is being used.
That's just my two cents though, maybe others disagree with my take","","ü§î (1)"

If, say, almost starving to death is 0 and ""I am about to explode"" full is 10, people usually try to start eating at 2-3 and finish eating at 7-8. If you got a lot of food left when ur 6, then you realise you won't be able to finish, and take whatever home. Noone should go up to 10, and if you have a french fry left while at 8, just eat it.

I cannot believe how everyone do not conclude on some logic like this, in a hypothetical where you are fed up to 10 and a single fry is left can never happen. Yea,  lets say you think it'll end at 9 and no you were wrong it's going up to 10 and there is a french fry left, yea just leave that one and next time try to do better. Both to not overfeed yourself and not waste food.

Is there any other take to the topic than this?","",""

The directionless design to me adds to the mystery and grandeur of this world, and the moment to moment gameplay is all about mastering tools like the spear and thrown objects. Stuff like ‚ÄòI can throw a spear at a plant to get infinite food‚Äô is a great way to reward the player for experimenting with the world. Other stuff like how you can kill a lizard by chucking a rock at its head then a spear is another great way to teach how to use the tools at your disposal. Other stuff like, I‚Äôm going to avoid the noodle fly babies to not anger the noodle fly mother is good enemy design for how to interact with your environment. When the areas are long and looping, it serves to add to this wandering feeling, where the map feels like a real place that has metamorphosed from years of misuse.  The water area on the way to moon for example is basically the collapsed remnants of moons supercity, which you get to see in other campaigns. Everything is designed and thought about to fit into the world building and design of the world. For example, farm arrays is basically the remnants of the food colonies of the ancients, and so is full of collapsed food passageways and the highest variety of flora in the game. Also you use fruits and the weeds are everywhere. Also once you leave moon, the blue Iggy leads you to pebbles.  || Anyways that‚Äôs my essay. Spoilers are included üôÇ","",""

Do you want people to just go ""I voted for Rain world"" no emotion, no happiness. Just facts. Of course, this is massively hypocritical, these same people will say how much they LOVE Kingdom Fantasy 7 Rebirth ULTRA or Rabi Ribi 2: The Dread of Hunger, they will spout on swearing up and down that they're the GREATEST game ever made all the while calling any and all Rain World fans out for even showing a sign of humanity.

On first watch all but the last thing seem partly justified cuz it's assumed Makoto got into crime himself and then him scamming Laurent and insistingly forcing himself into his car, onto his flight and then into his car again (I think he even asks him to get involved at some point? been a while) is like karma enough for what Laurent ends up manipulating him into (even then it's shaky at times but like bearable for me), but no it was all planned and he played him like a goddamn puppet it's disgusting||","",""

Indigo Prophecy is BETTER heavy rain.

Ace Attorney streams may be a hoot. Joe engaged with the humor a fair bit, and it has some great moments.

Life is Strange (only 1) is pretty great

Hello Neighbour is classic

AI Somnium files( havent watched the second game, but the first game was hilarious)

Yakuza 0 is fantastic (except the very end, where we encounter the worst stream moment in Joseph Anderson history)

There is a lot of dying, trial and error trying to get past certain rooms. However I do feel like as you go to other regions you find new creatures, level design, and discover techniques (ways to interact with the environment) and it is very satisfying.

The game can definitely be tedious and frustrating, especially if u are bottlenecked, but up to you if you to decide if you like that ‚Äúovercoming that challenge‚Äù.","","tooreal (1)"

Cool game but I'm still not totally sure what to think of it. This is probably massively hypocritical of me as a Rain World and Dark Souls lover but I feel like it might actually keep too much from the player. My defense is that so much in Funger is dependent on literal dice rolls so it's less forgivable than those games. I think there should be less brutal RNG shit and more communication to the player in certain areas, in esssence it just feels too trial-and-errory. To compensate for this I actually think the game should be more difficult in another area - I think reloading saves should be limited in some way and there should be a risk of permadeath. Something like the ink ribbon system in Resident Evil. But as is, reloading saves liberally is a necessity because of how much trial-and-error there is. Also, not completely sure how I feel about the abundance of rape.

Really my problem isn't at all that the game is brutal and challenging, one of the things I really like about it is how nerve-racking it is, which is why I even want to increase the chances of perma death and curb reloading/save scumming. I just feel like there's too often where the game will present some sort of choice or situation where I just dont feel briefed on what the possible consequences are if that makes sense. And again, there's too much RNG shit which compounds that problem by a lot. It's the sort of stuff that just makes me want to reload endlessly to see what to do or even run to a wiki. Again, maybe hypocritical of me as a RW/DS lover but I think the difference for me is that while those games keep you in the dark it feels like there's way less riding on you potentially making some sort of dumb choice. You always have your skill to fall back on in both RW/DS, it never really feels like your run is ruined or anything, in Funger you can fuck yourself over really badly because you're always at the mercy of RNG so you need all the help you can get ||","","HeinzGate (1)"
