xc1 is rife with flaws that the series expanded upon and fixed and it clearly isn't better than the rest of the series in every single way ever, in fact multiple aspects are rather rough and could do a better job explaining cos once in a popup tutorial is unfortunately something people will insta skip over

xc2 suffers from having expectations from the series and the rather overly anime cartoon joke tone at the start is a bit overpowering and is not consistent throughout the game, it's not mixed in well and not retained throughout. discounting this, the xenoblade 2 plot does eventually get to a consistent tone and comes together, and there's quite a lot to appreciate though some people don't see it as often due to not being immersed and not taking it as seriously. I think the torna dlc does a lot to address this.","",""
