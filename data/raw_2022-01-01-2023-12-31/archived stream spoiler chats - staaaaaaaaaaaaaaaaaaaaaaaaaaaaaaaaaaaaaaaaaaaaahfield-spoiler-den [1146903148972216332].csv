Not like in Skyrim where if you had the Greybeards point you to a shout or Delphine sent you a letter, they'd just be telling you where one already existed in the world. You could have a mix, the NPC tells you where to go and a space shout is guaranteed to be there *and* you can find one by random chance, but how rare should it be for you to find one by random chance? Too rare and you'll always use the NPC, too common and they'll stop feeling special. Plus if you simply make it a part of the procgen then it's putting the player at the whim of RNG. One could find 5 in a row, the other can go to 10 planets and not get squat. You could maybe brute force it and say ""Okay every five planets the player explores, there'll be a space shout"" but what happens if the player does a lot of exploring before even getting to the trigger point for them to begin spawning in the main quest? Is there enough content they'll still be exploring new planets? You could also attach it to quests that send players to planets to guarantee they might find them, like how you were talking about how it worked in Skyrim, but what quests should it be attached to? All of them? Radiant quests? Proper side quests? ||","",""

Sans any way to get them via exploration. Which is just a straight downgrade. But my point is that being able to find them simply by exploring sounds like a nightmare given the procgen. You're right that a mix would be good, especially if they tied it to locations generated by side quests, but the exploration avenue would still cause headaches development wise. This is also ignoring the possibility of just making the quests you go to get them more interesting. Like a cross between the tutorial shrines in Breath of the Wild and... I dunno, some sort of gauntlet, maybe? Like you hunt down an alien ruin and have to do some unique puzzles or challenges.

Bethesda's vision of the future is just slightly recolored present.
The only futuristic thing is ships. Everything else is mind-numbingly 1950s like it was ages ago. Bethesda followed the suite Black Isle set in first Fallouts, and it stuck to them.

Seriously, what in sf's world would strike as futuristic? Same beds. Same stoves. Same computer terminals with functionality of a door switch. Same fucking toilet paper. Same dogfighting warfare as defined by Boelcke in 1915. It's just boringly mundane without any spark of imagination.

Just a ""humans will never change in 200 years mentality"" It makes me think of the lone islander hypothesis that humans will never expand out of the solar system and the sun will eat us all that spoken by pessimistic people on twitter or old fucks who lived in the 80s with faulty visions of the future and became jaded as a result.
