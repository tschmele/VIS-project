the first spoiler in each line will just point you to the relevant rule/some trivial observation, the next one, if its not the last, will point you towards some maybe less obvious observation, the last will ask the relevant question

getting the board
1. ||the boxes youre going to get cannot overlap||, ||almost the full grid is filled by the line||, ||can you have empty tiles (as in without a segment of the line) in your boxes?||
2. ||you have an 11x11 grid you need to fit 9 9x9 non-overlapping boxes into||, ||you can ""remove"" up to 2 rows/columns and still be able to fit 9 such boxes in||, ||which rows/columns will effectively force you to remove 3 rows/columns if removed, and what are their intersections?||
3. ||the segments of the line cut by the boundaries of the box must add up to the same number||, ||the sum of all the digits in the box is 45||, ||what are the factors of 45 and therefore how many segments of the line must every box contain?||

solving the board
1. ||normal sudoku rules apply||, ||you have boxes where two rows/columns have 9 spaces to fill in, while on one side the other row/column has only 6 spaces to fill in and on the other side the fourth row/column has 3 spaces to fill in||, ||how do those 6 and 3 spaces correspond?||
2. ||normal sudoku rules apply||, ||sometimes you have a situation similar to the one in hint 1, but you have 3 spaces on one side and 9 spaces on the other side, where the 3 spaces are filled in by a fourth box||, ||what can you say about those 3 spaces, and the 3 spaces on the other side?||","",""

||  The break-in with the suspicously long thermo is very cool, but i started to enjoy the puzzle even more once it became about finishing each set of numbers.  

There's so many points where you logic leads you into a cage that lets you suddenly elimnate things,  very satisfying use of cages... always feels like the setter is one step ahead of your logic path ready to give you a helpful cage.

The way the sixes get placed is super cool, that's definetly a highlight.  The middle sixes you realize have to be all in a column because of the other two, the logic for the 21 cage of sixes is neat and feels like it breaks a lot open, and the left column of sixes is part of the break-in chain.    I was expecting those sixes to be there because otherwise the kropki dot wouldn't be relevant, so that was a good hint to figure out why they had to be there.  

Had to rollback a mistake with ones at one point in this puzzle, it's easy to get yourself mixed up on how the thermos must work

My favourite puzzle I think I've made is a liar puzzle called ""What Lies Beyond the Fog"": https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000G9A 
It's more challenging but it's also a Fog puzzle, which helps balance out the challenge by limiting the scope of where to look. 

For something of a similar challenge level but different rules, ""Wavy Zippers"" is a fun one and comes with the Marty Sears stamp-of-approval (he's been featured on the channel quite a bit, really great setter): https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000G8S","",""
