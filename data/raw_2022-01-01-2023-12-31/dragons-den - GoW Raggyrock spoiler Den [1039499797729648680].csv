Well pretty much, I feel like this whole area was the dlc that was planned but was eventually slapped onto this game. Not saying that this area is bad, it is actually quite good! Though this whole area has felt so much more in line with gow 2018 than what the second game has already set up. I could be wrong, and it could very well just be poor game design of not evolving on the mechanics you have set up, but this area feels so much like the first game it's scary like okay, here are my main reasons||
||1) you are on a boat, exploring an area that is somewhat similar to the look of midgar
2) Many of the enemies are either ripped straight from the first game, or evolutions of enemies from the first game
3) It explores an existing characters mistakes (Mimir) and doenst have too much to do with what is currently going on
4) it feels very self contained
5) Many of the puzzles feel like soft evolutions from the stuff set up in 2018
Basically what I'm saying is that this whole area feels way more reminiscent of 2018 rather than what the game has already set up and evolved on in the previous section of the game. Again I'm not saying I don't like, It's just a theory, a game theory <:Jomseph:959729899634061322> ||

Idk if I like how the game does the side areas, so far the general structure is to romp through some main story in a realm and a new section within the realm opens up and the main story grinds to halt for you to explore a new map region while exploring some kind of character dynamic, so far it was Dwarf realm = mimir, ||Alfheim = Atreus, and Freyas Birth realm = Freya|| While it is pretty good exploration Idk if I like how exploring means that the main story just fucking grinds to a halt. I like that it focuses on the characters and there have been great moments within these side stories, though it just gets exhausting cause you have to make a choice between pushing forward the plot, or character exploration.

Story was not as good as the previous game. 
the entire angrboda plotline could have been deleted and lose nothing. i'm still not certain it really makes any sense at all tbh. Having the whole rift tear plotline amount to nothing at all in the end is a major buzzkill for me. The villians were far better characterized than a lot of the side characters like vanyr.
combat was better.  the 3rd weapon was a nice addition. changing up companion characters and playing as Atreus kept things interesting.
exploration was about the same. my only complaint is it felt like some guy wrote a script for each zone and then just chopped it into 30 or so small pieces and have characters say like 3 lines of it eacht ime there was a break in combat. and they did this for every quest in the whole game.","",""

As well as the dwarf that conveniently points out where the god is being captured. It bothered me how easily they found him in a random cave. But it was easy because Odin wanted them to find him.
But everything after that is falling apart. He gained their trust, infiltrated their ranks. Has influence on them. What he does? Absolutely nothing. He's bitching and moaning. Why not represent ""alternative"" view on the problem? Try to convince them that it's is crucial to prevent Ragnorok. Do exactly what he strives to. Kratos doesn't want a war. Atreus wants to prevent the prophecy where his father dies. It would be so easy to manipulate them. He actually could secretly coerce Atreus to go see Odin behind his fathers back, creating the rift between the two, slowly winning the boy's trust over his fathers. And eventually luring him into going to Asgard and finding the mask pieces for him.
Because as far as I concerned he does none of that. He does say he doesn't want a war, but when they say, ok but we want, he just lets it go. Isn't Odin supposed to be really persuasive? When he finds out about the false prophesy and the fact that only Asgard is to fall he doesn't act either. Atreus runs off on his own, it wasn't part of Odin's plan, or at least he wasn't doing shit to achieve this goal. And to top it all off. When it was finally time for him to lure everyone into his trap, he's being exposed by Brok of all people. In summary - he successfully infiltrates the group. Does absolutely nothing. And getting discover miserably not achieving none of his goals. The Odin. The great mastermind Mimir told all his stories about. Is this really it, or did I miss something?

I like his characterization, but his actions in the late-game felt contradictory to it.  
He seems like a somewhat pragmatist leader, and I feel like despite the deaths of Magni/Modi and later Heimdall (which he could have prevented), it'd be in his interests to meet with the Kratos gang and talk things out, you know, to prevent a war that would lead to the destruction of his realm and the complete end of times? He would have also gotten what he wanted from the mask from Atreus without any conflict.
Instead, the writers decided that he was some evil, double personality Pixar/Scoobydoo/Bethesda villain who stabbed the heroes because they needed a twist. 
Compared to what we got there would have been a lot of potential to give this character depth, he could have been remembered as one of the best video game antagonists. Instead he's just some one-dimensional obstacle. I just don't see anything worth acclaiming in this story...","",""

The more you think about it the more Ragnarok appears to be the reason for these two to have these interactions and a whole realm is being sacrified just for a father and son story, INSTEAD of the alternative being a very well told story taking place in another, larger and more grand EQUALLY well told story of this realm going through its Ragnarok reckoning.","",""

Cory Barlog is gone. and while we already know what happens when you take away a director of one of the best video games ever made and let the sequel be directed by someone who was nowhere near as involved, thats not enough problems on Santa Monica's plate
then covid happens, but i still dont think thats the biggest issue
the main issue is the ps4. Sony realized the PS5 became a loss-leader, since noone is actually buying it to play games, they buy it to scalp them 
so Sony says the exclusives are now PS4 compatible. Why the fuck Demon's Souls 2020 didnt get back-patched i have no clue
so Santa Monica now has to make this game backwards compatible for the PS4
so you combine all these issues, and then the game has to get released in 2022, if you're like me and dont count 2020 as a real dev year, they forced this thing out the door in 3 years when the previous game was made in 4","",""

kratos, atreus, thor, and odin are all involved in this core theme
kratos was a monster but learned to control and temper himself with honor and duty
atreus could become a monster (loki) but learned honor and duty from kratos, but also he taught kratos compassion.
odin was and is a monster and raised thor to be a monster and thor raised his two sons to be monsters because none of them knew honor, duty, or compassion.
thor almost gets a second chance to learn from kratos and atreus how to raise a child (thrud) but then he gets killed and it's a real waste of a character. odin gets killed because he's too far gone, that's fine.
how to fix this imo: atreus turning into loki the evil manipulative trickster god should have been an actual threat, it should be implied that faye fell in love with kratos because she knew through future sight that he would be the kind of father atreus needs to temper and control loki, thor should get his second chance to be a good father, and the kratos dies prophecy should have been resolved by atreus tricking the prophecy with the giant marbles by storing kratos's soul and bringing him back later; turning his loki-trickster-god nature and abilities towards a compassionate goal","","HeinzGate (2)"

Local stories, personal dialogs, few locations, battles are grounded, even Buldur imo. 2018 was a build up. Mimir in 2018 was so  entertaining bacause he was telling about the lore, letting us finish the full image for ourselfs. In Ragnarok we can't do that. They HAVE to show. Show Odin, Thor, all nine realms, the Ragnarok. 
Local stories still work in that game. Like Atreus and Kratos dynamic, Thor's family, Sindri and Brok. But the moment they increase the scope everything falls apart. Ragnarok is just background for their family problems, that's what devs REALLY wanted to talk about, not some epic battles or mysterious masks. And when it's time to put Ragnarok on the foreground it never stops to be a background. It has little effort in it and now you can clearly see it.","","tooreal (2)"

I personally hated Odin because he struck me as a colonizer. Sure he may not have done direct harm to our heroes (until Brok ) but I still empathized with Svartalfheim and the other realms.

Now a lot of that empathy comes from my own experience living in the Caribbean and the region's history with western  colonialism.

I think the writers could have explored the effects of Odin's hold on the  various realms in a more direct way to foster empathy instead of the nonsense with Brok
