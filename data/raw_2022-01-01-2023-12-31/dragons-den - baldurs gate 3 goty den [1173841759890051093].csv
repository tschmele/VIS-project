- Major developments later in a storyline

     - Something like ||the guardian being a mind flayer and also being Balduran|| is big spoilers and should be marked
- Outcomes to quests
- Basically anything that happens in Act 3, honestly
Essentially, just mark anything that you would consider to be a ""big reveal."" What that is will change from person to person, but it's a decent baseline (that Joe himself established with his general spoiler ruling).","",""

Then I freed Omeluum and have him dash towards the dad so that they can teleport together into the submarine without the dad taking a single step.
