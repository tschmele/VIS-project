She casts a spell to protect Rabi Ribi island from the outside world. For some reason regular bunnies start fucking killing each other, to fix this she casts a spell that makes her lose her body, and exiles her from the island, and it works in stopping them from killing each other. She casts another spell that removes memories from everyone who knew her so they not sad and also changes her name to Noah. Her spell to protect Rabi Ribi island remains active post exile.

The memory removing spell is not 100% succesful so when Rumi gets a new bunny she names it Erina because she kind of remembers the original. Eventually in exile she decides she wants to go back, so she uses the big stone thing to lure Miru, holding Erina, to the stone where she then teleports them to her place. There she gives Erina a body that's pretty much her old one, but she doesn't have enough magic to take over her body.

She sends Erina back for this reason since Miru being seperated from Erina will cause her to be sad which will result in greater magical power which she can then siphon. After she has enough magic she tries to take over Erinas body but Erina beats her up and Noah dies due to no longer having enough magic, lamayo","","HeinzGate (5)"

```
did you know that rabbits can sleep with their eyes open? if your bunny is crouching down and its nose isn't twitching, it might be asleep!

did you know that rabbits' tails aren't round circles? they're actually flat and wide, and only appear circular at some angles because bunnies almost always keep them raised. zoologists think that predators sometimes confuse the tail for the bunny's head when the bunny makes a sharp turn, and that juke is enough for the bunny to get away.

did you know that carrots and similar starchy vegetables are not a regular part of a rabbit's? Bugs Bunny was originally depicted as holding a carrot in reference to a popular movie at the time, which had an iconic scene with some dude eating carrots.

did you know you can easily get already-neutered rabbits for free sometime after Easter? animal shelters are full of abandoned impulse pets, and will gladly accept adoptions as long as you can answer a quiz on responsible care.

did you know that rabbits have natural litterbox instincts, especially when neutered? they will do their business wherever their hay supply is, so you can let your bunny wander around rooms that have been rabbit proofed!

did you know that in a rabbit's digestive system, their ""appendix"" is a large chamber dedicated to digesting plant matter? because this is located AFTER the small intestine, rabbits slurp the fermented you-know-what out of their you-know-where when the ""appendix"" tells them that the veggies are ready to soft serve.

There are 4 of each pieces- Goal is to have 4 sets of 3 and 1 set of 2. Sets of 3 can be formed either by having 3 of the same piece, or 3 sequential pieces, for example 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 4-5-6, etc, are all valid. set of 2 have to be the same piece. In addition you need a Yaku which there are a bunch of. You can take other pieces when discarded if it results in a set of 3 for you, but this reveals those 3 pieces to another player and makes you lose hidden hand, which is often where the Yaku's come in, because simply having a hidden hand is considered a Yaku. Certain very specific Yaku's win you the round without having 4 sets of 3 and 1 set of 2.","","JoeThonk (5)"
