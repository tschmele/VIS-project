Tama and Ryuki work really well together and seeing the mental deterioration occur was very intense but very intriguing at the same time. The mizuki route started off promising but once the timeline twist happened the game completely flew off the rails in the worst way possible. So much of it feels like repeats of stuff Uchikoshi has already done, from the intentional hiding of the date to trick you to the magical suicide virus to the secret clones, the ending just being a ripoff of AI1's ending, it's very disappointing. It's also very strange that the twist from the first game didn't come back around besides to make a joke about Date's appearance. The Somniums were much better this time (with the exception of the Masked Girl's and Tokiko's), with Shoma's being my favorite. Way too many dance sequences, and the QTEs just feel so weird, like they didn't really fit in. The Date fakeout as well seemed really dumb. Tearer wasn't a very good villain either, like he needed something more to him for things to really click together. Ultimately it's an Uchikoshi game through and through||","",""

it feels like there's a huge gulf between people who see the contrived shit uchi does to make his twists work and go ""haha, classic uchikoshi, cool twist btw"" and people who go ""this is UNACCEPTABLE WRITING and i HATE EVERY MOMENT OF MY EXISTENCE PLAYING THIS""

personally, i'm in the former camp. i really don't see anything inherently wrong with starting with an idea for a twist and then building the story around that. it usually makes character writing much harder since ""slice of life""/character development scenes and dialogue that would be innocuous in other stories can drastically compromise the structure of an intricately-plotted uchikoshi-style story, and uchikoshi doesn't _really_ ever overcome that challenge to make truly emotionally impactful stories.

||that all said, i do prefer AI 1 slightly more since it managed to hit those emotional character highs at points,  particularly in Mayumi's route. And I think that's no coincidence - the twist in AI 1 imposed much fewer restrictions on the way the story can be structured, only really directly restricting the behavior of people who got body-swapped; everyone else was relatively free to act like an actual human being. Whereas in AI 2, essentially everybody must behave in service of the timeline twist, awkwardly tiptoeing around details that would give away the twist right up until it's about to be revealed. I think Ryuki got shafted the hardest, with his mental illness struggles mostly existing to sow confusion over the realiability of his narrative.

So I absolutely agree something is lost when a twist becomes so ambitious it puts chains on the rest of the writing, I just think it's a tradeoff that can be worth it. I'm inherently sympathetic to these authors like uchikoshi and the sekimeiya guys who want to pull off something mind-blowing and grand while still delivering at least some of the beats of a normal story. Writing an engaging story without any particular restrictions is hard enough; even pulling half of one off with the goals these ontological-adjacent mystery writers set for themselves is impressive to me.||","",""

I think the problem is that the game actively lies to you, to get the twist to work. VLR doesn't lie to you ~~about the timeline lul~~, 999 doesn't lie to you, they present their info right in front of your eyes and you can figure the main twists for both those games, and people are rightfully annoyed at the parts that were explicitly obscured in the games.
Meanwhile, this game tells you ""here is a timeline, uwu"" and then explicitly goes ""actually ahahaha that isn't the timeline lol SUCKAAAA"" and that really sucks for a murder mystery story. Like, a big aspect of the murder mystery genre is that you should be able to figure out who the killer is or how the murders happened *before* the game reveals it to you, and when it purposely obscures information from the player in order to create a surprising twist, this is simply impossible.||","",""

And then you have the fact that many people liked that the first game was more grounded, aside from the sci-fi elements that were explicitly established in game.

But even given that, when I was playing AI 2 and discussing it with friends in DMs, we all picked up on timeline weirdness relatively early on into Mizuki route, so I'm not buying that the twist is impossible this time. Hell, you have A Flurry Of Owls up there dropping a ton of consecutive instances of the ""timeline discrepencies"" showing up more and more as you get closer to the twist reveal - if he stopped right there and thought hard about what could explain the supposed time gap between most of the body halves, is it really ""impossible"" to figure out? The first major clue is Shoma's disappearance from the Ferris wheel back in Ryuki's route; once you start suspecting timeline shenanigans, it seems very natural for that event + Ryuki's established memory issues to link in and provide the foundation for a solved mystery.

Is it fair? Not really, there is no principled way to single out the flowchart presentation alone as truly misleading and every other relevant clue as reliable. But with how many people I've seen notice relevant clues once they get past about 1/3rd into Mizuki route, I'm hard-pressed to see how it's impossible for someone to stumble onto the answer.||","",""

Usually, you want to present something to your audience, so the answer is right in their face, but they don't get it until you give them that 1 final clue - here, the game just outright lies to you as far as I know, which annoys people. This is also why people (DRV3 case 1) haaaaaaaate the Kaede twist, since the game actively hides Kaede's thoughts from you.

I suspect it's all just *shrug* Uchikoshi shit, let it go, because it's to serve the narrative, but it's still pretty annoying when the attention to detail is otherwise pretty stellar","","Valle (1)"

In short, it's pretty good, but I didn't personally enjoy it as much as the first game, and while the first one is an easy recommendation to anyone I know generally, I wouldn't say this one is for lots of reasons.

spoilery thoughts/discussion (full game for AI-1 & AI-2, you've been warned):
||I simply think there are too many combinations of dumb-shit, coincidences, and what i'll call ""writing black holes"" to be satisfying, *especially* as a ""murder mystery"". In the first game, aside from the huge twist of ""body swapping is a thing"" and the coincidence of ""on one path, Saito gets in a car crash"", everything logically follows, makes sense, and you can even reason about it, and there are essentially no loose ends by the epilogue. Even the implied morbing is also explained by the ""fractal amnesia"" thing, which is true to real life even. In AI-2, there are just too many things that have to be deliberately hidden from the player through ""don't-think-about-it"" black holes, writing contrivances, and actual proper unreliable narrator type shenanigans. This is all ignoring some of the other glaring issues like how some Somniums are fucking awful to play through (Tokiko & ""Masked Woman""/Bibi are primary offenders)||

Now do all these things make the game bad? No, I still think it's pretty good, just not something I'll look back at as fondly as the first game

It isn't ""for no reason"", she literally calls herself a ninja because she's meant to be a secret to a lot of people. 4) I'm not sure what crime scene you're talking about, but any three of them aren't a problem; we don't know Ryuki didn't investigate the classroom where Chikara's right half was (it's not like there were any clues there to begin with), he most likely DID investigate Dvaita where Komeji was killed, or else he didn't because Tearer got to him first and took control over Ryuki (since that's the day you play as Bibi, where Ryuki shoots her and you learn about his betrayal, so it happened very recently, and not on the day prior, where you _were_ Ryuki), and the Cathedral... well, there's a lot of baggage there for him, so it's obvious why he'd avoid it. 5) people being suspect in a Wink Psync doesn't automatically mean it's connected to the case. You can't really investigate a lead you don't know is a lead, right? Especially ABIS, since they need to be certain they can glean important information during Psyncs. 6) I know the 'you didn't ask' plotpoint can be lame, but there's no reason for anyone to question Amame's parentage enough to look into it. She isn't even a person of interest.||","",""

The only in universe reason I can think of is to prevent Mizuki from knowing? which seems like a shitty reason. Also how did she know that she wouldn't run into Mizuki on the even days? If she wants to prevent her from finding out the only logical thing to do is to walk around in your ninja suit all the time. It would creep people out but she doesn't seem to care on the even days when she is wearing it so why not? 4) I'm talking about Komeji's crime scene - he doesn't look into it until 6 years later and it's what leads him to Amame. If he did what he did at the other crime scenes then he would have found tearer there and then. 5) the people you're looking at are persons of interest in a case - if they see suspicious shit you go after them until you know that it's not. 6) again, police not knowing who the son/daughter of a suspect is can only be gross incompetence||","",""

As for why he didn't get rid of it, maybe he just didn't want to chance it. If the body was hidden elsewhere then he couldn't be sure it'd stay hidden, which ruins the point of him hiding it for Amame's sake. 8) Nobody realizes there are two cathedrals until the end. Ryuki didn't talk about what he saw in the Cathedral 2 likely due to the TC-PERGE infecting him at that point, and he went too crazy to remember, having an episode thinking it was 6 years ago. 9) Gen wouldn't be arrested for what he did, since the statue of limitations was up. At the least, they didn't need to send the Super Police for it. Mizuki's never been good with just accepting authority doing what it wants, y'know? 10) Boss probably gave special permission for Date and the Mizukis to go into the Stadium alone.

Bibi has been looking after Mizuki from afar, I don't think it's wild that she'd have a good idea where not to go un-disguised. Plus, she was disguised for Ryuki too, who wasn't supposed to know about her either. Him knowing is a mistake due to his betrayal. 4) I just gave reasons as to why Ryuki might have, or might not have, investigated Studio Dvaita - maybe he did, _did_ find Tearer, and that's how Tearer got him under his thumb. Or he didn't, because Tearer called him to the Cathedral first, so he was blackmailed into not investigating. Either way, the day immediately after Komeji's death is when Ryuki got strong-armed into being a pawn for Tearer, and that definitely affected his ability to investigate further. 5) for the most part, they aren't. There are seemingly superficial connections at first, but it isn't until those connections become _clear_ they're related to the case, then they start looking into it. That, like, isn't an issue.||","",""

I am going to spoiler tag my prediction that would explain a lot of details because doubt people might believe i was able to figure it out if dont write it before confirmation, i also havent checked to timeline to confirm it just in case. So; ||I originally thought both POVs were actually somehow happening at the same time, that there were no past/future division, there are too many details that conflic with that but also many that make sense if they do. But I might have figured out. There arent 2 POVs, there are 3. Left side is 100% Ryuki, in the past, whose perspective is only partially revealed somehow (probably perge). Right is Mizuki, but hers intertwine with the ""Masked Woman"" who is the OG Mizuki, Mizuki Date being a clone of her. That explains the line that fucked me the most ""I have a younger sister"" just how tf?! And I always noticed that the files mention Boss adopted Mizuki, and Boss talks in game about her in both routes. I think Mizuki Date memory about Older Mizuki are also messed somehow or for some reason. So there are 2 POVs in the past, which explains A LOT OF DETAILS and 1 in the future which EXPLAINS A LOT OF DETAILS. These shenaningans might be part of Nirvana Initiative in purpose by Tearer on Naix, which I hope goes 100% pure meta, like, DDLC style but with a much more interesting and complex context. I think the lamest way this could go if it is just a DR2 situation instead. Regardless of how it will actually end, the fact that this games biggest mysteries arent even about the case itself but meta mysteries and they have messed with my head so much is already a huge plus in my book, i am having a blast||","",""

||even if we blindly accept that the player is jumping in this hyperspecific way, tokiko has no way of knowing that we jump in said hyperspecific way even if we accept that she just knows that the frayer exists. the way you are given the nil number only makes sense if tokiko knows this hyperspecific jumping pattern and she simply can't. even if we accept that she knows that the frayer is an entity that jumps back and forth exactly 6 years at midnight on 4 specific days from ryuki and mizuki/bibi's perspective and can also jump back in time to deliver the nil number to her, she has no reason to not just tell ryuki the nil number immediately and then let the frayer rewind a minute and have him tell her to trigger moksha since the fact that ryuki knowing the nil number is impossible at that point and saying it anyway is all that is required to create a seam||","",""

I find I am intrigued by the mysteries and then another character mentions Simulation Theory, finding seams or tearing and I groan through my skin. I'm very done with ""villain"" is a fully masked clothed character with a magic voice changer also. In regards to the Komeji ending, while I liked Shoma the whole thing is infuriating because I find Komeji a thoroughly unlikeable character. His motivations of following his dream because he 'wants to make people smile' falls hollow when he makes nobody smile because he is absolutely terrible at his craft, and no-one finds him funny or comes to see him. Guy refuses to just get a steady job when he does one literal paid gig a month for $50, that he could fit into any Sunday, and puts his family in danger by getting involved with literal Yakuza rather than just provide. And then we have to spend the last 10 minutes of that ending with Shoma apologising as if any of his feelings or actions towards his deadbeat father weren't warranted (breaking the gold star is a dick move though).||","","pensivewobble (2)"
