We are opening applications for new mods for the server. If you are interested in joining the mod team then please copy and paste and then answer the questions below in a DM to <@378990562948415488>

Expectations of you in terms of time commitment are quite low--this is best suited for someone who is already an active member of the community and is willing to do some moderating while they hang out here like they always do. You'll be expected to uphold the rules and be involved in some moderator discussions on issuing warnings, bans, or some rule changes.

---

1) What is your time zone? (When are you active on the server, typically?)

2) When did you first join this server?

3) Do you have anyone muted or blocked on this server? If so, why?

4) Is there anyone who, if they were also applying to be a mod right now and were accepted, would make you reconsider this position?

5) Why do you feel you would be a good mod and why do you want to be one?

6) And finally, most importantly: Who is your waifu/husbando?","","👍 (26),🇬 (55),🇷 (58),🇪 (55),🅰️ (58),🇹 (55),🥕 (56),🥦 (61),Jomseph (19),SparkleHeartTrans (13),TransHype_Parker (11),HeinzGate (11),JoeBan (6),jph2Bucket (5),AstoHeh (7),JerryW (4),flabbergasted (3),Mari_Laugh (3),jphPog (5),🇼 (2)"
