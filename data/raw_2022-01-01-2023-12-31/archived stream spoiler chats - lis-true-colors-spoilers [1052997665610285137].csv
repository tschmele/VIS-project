I don't think he's sympathetic, but I don't think you need to or even necessarily *should* make serial killers sympathetic characters. Like we don't need to give him the shitty true crime doc ""misunderstood but i can fix him"" stan culture glow-up. He can just be deranged and creepy: the important thing is that it's believable and that he represents something important to the story. And when it comes to the latter, I think there's actually a lot of potential, and even if it's arguably a bit cliche, his motivation of ""preserving the innocence"" of the subjects he photographs and capturing that moment in time is a fascinating one with inroads to a thematically satisfying conclusion.

It plays off Max's interests as a photographer and her motivations as a time traveler. She's trying to hold onto what she still has and that's why it fits to have Jefferson as this mentor figure to her. He's of the same mindset, just taking it to its most twisted and horrid conclusion, obsessively fetishizing the youth of his students and trying to Peter Pan them before they get ""twisted"" by the harsh realities of the world. And in the same vein, Max is (or in a good story *would be*) trying to protect her own innocence and her own view of life and the people in it. She wants to believe Chloe is a good person, she wants to believe she's doing the right thing, she wants to believe in a simple black-and-white binary and save the childhood that's being stolen from her. But she needs to learn to let go of that innocence and to accept the murky, muddy transition from her rose-tinted youth into the real world of flawed people and tough choices.","","HeinzGate (5),joeYes (2)"

The problem in BtS is now they actually have Rachel as a character so they have to write her. They still spend the 1st hour of the first episode having everyone talk about how perfect Rachel is, and finally they introduce her properly with Chloe getting to talk with her, and... She's just a girl? She's nothing special honestly, which goes against everything you've heard about her up to this point. And of course it practically has to be this way because how do you actually write someone as perfect as they set her up to be.

rachel amber is just... who? i guess her dad is a cheater? who cares?
and i'm sure there will be more revealed about her or whatever but the issue is that in twin peaks, laura is a *major* force that you feel looming over the story and you're aching to know more about her, despite her being found dead in the very first scene of the series. in life is strange, did *anyone* go ""man, this rachel character is so intruiging, i want to know more about her""? she's just not the focus.","","HeinzGate (2)"

-fire walk with me is a prequel film about laura palmer's last days. should be watched in-between seasons 1/2 and season 3 (called ""the return"")

In LiS 2 it is shown that Daniel has telekenisis powers, and in LiS 2 ep 2 you get to the part where Daniel and Sean watch him fall and Daniel saves him using telekenisis powers, but they pretend that they are amazed that he stopped himself since they don't want anyone to know Daniel has telekenisis. Daniel keeps entertaining the idea that Chris has powers by using his own real telekenisis for Chris when Chris is trying to use his fake telekenisis (i might be explaining it badly). Depending on choices you can fess up to Chris that it is actually Daniel that has telekenisis. If you don't, then at the end when cops come for Sean and Daniel, Chris will run infront of a cop car to try and stop it with telekenisis. If Daniel was encouraged to use telekenisis he will use it to stop the cop car, if he was not encouraged then the cop car hits Chris. One of the only good consequences imo.

So yeah, let me write my problem with this:
1) Happened too soon. I give zero shits about these characters yet. Generally you need to make me care about your characters before tragedy strikes them.
Yeah, Chloe was shot very soon into episode 1, but because of rewind powers she is fine at the start. 

2) This is a very heavy and serious premise. Don't trust the writers of Life is Strange to so a good job with it. 

3) it's often really hard to make a kid character not be annoying. At least for me, I hate annoying kid characters in stories, it can ruin all the enjoyment for me.","","salutezume (1)"

Have the dad shot and kid exploding at the end of Episode 1 instead of the beginning. The time between could be a smoother introduction into Daniel's powers with the boom at the end signalling how strong he can be.

The caravan that they join for a bit in Episode 5? Make them recurring characters. If the boys are able to travel for a while with a little cast, you get to reuse them instead of having to make more models, and plus you can have David around for longer (and would be easier to introduce their mother into the conflict). Can still have the marijuana farm incident if you want.

Have both brother sbe able to do the thing. Might ruin some of what the game is going for (teaching Daniel how to use them) but could introduce something for the pair to actually be conflicted about, with Daniel being stronger at a baseline than Sean. This way the player gets to have a bit of fun too.","",""

The rewind stuff worked well for LiS1, but LiS2 could've absolutely been good without it. If anything I actually think you being an influence on David is the more interesting central mechanic by quite a bit. 

And the reason why the characters not being realistic or deep hurts this game more than it does LiS1 is because this game is trying to have a more serious and mature narrative. It's not just a sci fi power fantasy exploring teenagehood, it's trying to tackle serious themes with real world import like race relations in America. I also think the central mechanic being all about how one can guide the development of a human being necessitates deeper characters.

After thinking about the entire series as a whole and trying to figure out why aside from the first game the rest were so uninteresting, I suddenly had a thought.

Maybe the reason Life is Strange 1 was able to be more engaging was due to its structure as a genre-mashed story. 
Supernatural/Sci-fi Mystery + Character Drama.
On one side, you have a story about people and their problems. On the other side, you have a superpower and its usage to explore.","",""

In Lis 2, the supernatural elements were only used to set up the character drama. True Colors used it more, but because Empathy was such an uninteresting superpower, it could've basically been removed and everything would have played out the same way.

Only Lis 1 managed to do both sides of its plot equally. While the other games didn't try at all and instead leaned harder on character drama. (50/50. 0/100. 70/30. 80/20.)
