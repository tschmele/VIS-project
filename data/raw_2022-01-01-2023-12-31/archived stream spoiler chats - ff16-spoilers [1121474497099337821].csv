I don't have a problem with people disliking a game here. FF16 has some bad stuff, sure. But when someone starts ripping into even the mediocre stuff because now they hate it goes a bit too far for me.

I don't know man, like I found  nothing wrong with the Kupka and the Sanbreque scene- but people are ripping on it like wtf is this cringe... eh, that felt weird 

and the dialogue in this game has been good. it leans into the ff tactics, vagrant story, but it's not overtly flowery or basic. and yet people here are like - wow, ripping off GoT much? GoT didn't invent this kind of dialogue. It's okay if you don't like the quests or the pacing, but I don't think there's any part of the writing that makes this cringe

Thought the story and characters were great, despite some pacing issues with the story and some characters being underutilized. 

I’m having mixed feelings on the ending. On the positive side, the stuff with ||Clive’s memory of Joshua|| was beautiful and got me to tear up, which I don’t do easily with any piece of media. The final boss fight was also really fun. On the other hand, ||having the final antagonist be a godlike being and having Clive destroy all magic|| was frustratingly uninventive. As far as well-worn tropes go, it’s written decently well here, but I would’ve preferred something more original. I’m also split over ||Clive’s apparent (but not 100% confirmed) death. On one hand, having him sacrifice himself to save his brother and free the world feels like a logical, if tragic, conclusion for his character. On the other hand, it feels like a betrayal of the theme of Clive learning to *save himself*, as Jill and Joshua told him to do||. 

My most negative feeling about the ending is that I think ||it really wants for a “where are they now epilogue” showing the characters rebuilding the lives after Ultima’s defeat||. The way the epilogue just shows that the ||world will be okay in the long run isn’t satisfying as an answer to the individual fates of the characters. It reminds me of the scene with the kid and the storyteller in the base game Mass Effect 3 ending||, which is not a favorable comparison.","",""

The most obvious interpretation at face value is ||that Clive revives Joshua, destroys the last mothercrystal, and dies. Jill and Torgal mourn him and Joshua writes a book about his adventures||.

When you look at the details, particularly some of the context provide by late game sidequests, this gets turned on its head. ||Jill says that she fears for Clive every time he leaves, but he returns like “the break of dawn”. Harpocrates tells Clive to put down the sword and pick up the pen, and Clive says he’ll consider it. The narrator of the story is Clive.

We're told the kingdom rely on their mothercrystals, but really their military might is derived from their dominants, which is why for example Sanbreque seems largely unaffected by the loss of their crystal.
Clive grows stronger and stronger throughout the game, but at no point does he *need* the powers from the other Eikons to progress, so the narrative purpose of that is really vague.
They could've make something with the pieces they have, make some thematic connections - wanting to free enslaved bearers but simultaneously playing into the hands of a bad guy who wants to erase free will, that's something, right? - but they just didn't.

If you folks don't mind, I have a question about Ultima's plan: What exactly *was* his plan in the first place? I still don't get this so I'll just describe what I understood so y'all can correct me. I'm spoilering all of it just in case

||So the previous world was populated by his race and humans which they created but the humans being given magic resulted in the blight coming cause they sucked up all the aether from using the magic so he or they (Ultima's race) moved this new world to start over again... but humans awakened (?) too early and started using magic too early which resulted in the blight again so he wants to start over a second time but this time without humans and a perfectly subservient race with no magic at all to completely sidestep the blight. And to do this, he created the mothercrystals to suck up all the aether from this new land and collect the power. Clive thwarts this and (somehow) destroys the magic in the land so people now consider using magic through the crystals as fairy tails||

Is any of that correct?","",""

Timeline - ||Basically, it goes something like this|| -
1. Ultima ||and his alien crew arrive on Valisthea. Having lost their corporeal form (which looks like Ifrit Risen) they decide to a) create the crystals, 8 of them. b) create humanity. c) seed 8 tribes of humanity with magic from which one day the eikons would emerge and later on Mythos. d) go to sleep|| 
2. Fallen - ||While Ultima slumbers, human get very advanced. They invent magitek, flying airships and all cool gadgets. However, they get too greedy, something something, Ultima wakes up and destroys them and a crystal. Civilization is fallen, some go to other continent, Ultima sleeps once more||
3. Past - ||Mankind rises again. Kingdoms are formed. Castles are built. There's a period of time where innate Magic Users take charge, but Non-magic users use the crystals and  manage to defeat them. Then they enslave them - Bearers are born.||
4. Eikons - ||The seeds sown by Ultima finally begin to emerge. Eikons and Dominants are now being born.||
5. Mythos - ||The Mythos Clive Rosfield is born. (Conjecture from here on forth) The Eikon Ifrit is the incomplete version of Ultima's actual form (and thus is outside the trad 8). But given that Ifrit Risen is supposed to be Ultima's form, I think Mythos would have always descended from Fire/Phoenix lineage and then taken over the other powers||","",""
