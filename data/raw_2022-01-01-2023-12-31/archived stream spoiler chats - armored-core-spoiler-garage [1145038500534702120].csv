you're never going to get good damage on a moving target past 130 meters, so there's no reason to build for anything other than close range
and since the stagger state is so powerful, being a stun that increases damage taken, you also want to be staggering enemies as much as possible
it just so happens that the zimmerman shotgun is very overtuned and should probably lose about a third of its damage and impact
