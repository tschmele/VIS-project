Depending on what you want to learn, both options can help in improving your art. If its the apple-study, perhaps you wanna look at how light affects the apple, if an artist, perhaps youre studying what makes their art theirs (like is it the rendering, the colours etc.) 

The easiest way to start is pick a object and just draw it whilst looking at it (for the first one) or (for the second) pick a few pieces from the artist in mind and see what mediums they used, how stylization affects the piece, perhaps what kind of colours/tones they gravitate to","",""

The ""intended"" way was to scramble in the vicinity of the right keys with the left hand while keeping your eyes on the screen and dodging with the right, but honestly whatever works

I say this as someone who makes a lot of stuff they don't like but that other people seem to like quite a bit - your art is good. It's clear you're putting a lot of effort into it, and I think that work is paying off.

I would love a sliver of your time to suggest some title/s, or franchises, that you think utilize this mechanic uniquely, or are in a way obscure either in their genre, or because of where and by whom they were released.

This is the link to the poll we're using to gather the samples: https://forms.gle/RiTk9mmMoqtCURRKA
Inside the poll you can find an additional link that features our full sample as of this moment, and it is voluntary for you to skim through it to avoid repetition.

But we'd love any insight you feel like sharing! Since we started, we encountered a lot of games where their conceptions of companions proved to be quite interesting (for example Death Stranding, and its use of robots who just carry your packages), so give us anything you think would apply!

Thank you so much to those of you who will give us your time, and again, I hope this channel was ok to post this in, I really wanted an insight from Joseph's community.😁","",""

With two V16 engines mounted on top of each other to power the two sets of propellers this fighter-interceptor could reach an astonishing 723 Kph at an altitude of 5000 meters. 

The Axt is armed with:
One propeller mounted type 5 machinecannon (30mm) containing 60 Rounds per gun with an internal shell container to avoid propeller strikes

Four wing mounted Orelikon FF machinecannons (20mm) containing 150 rounds per gun. 

Four wing mounted hardpoints as well as one mounted far back on the fuselage. With a total maximum of 650kg of ordinance

The climbing speed of this aircraft was fairly decent however if a tight turning radius was a nessecity then a high airspeed was required as well.

All in all the A9M9 was a great late war fighter and even with only 240-ish being built they are believed to have been one of the key componenets to stopping allied bombing invasions that tore through the fortress of japan before the rejection letter bombing.

As for this piece, I do like the flats but it looks so, well, flat. Without the textures. There's so much to day, just off the top of my head: 

1. Add the greenary to pool
2. Add grass to the fields along with flowers
3. Complete the sky, add clouds and moons
4. Textures for the pool
5. Cracked Wall textures.

A few hours later I'd already written out the entire lyrics for a cover of it but with the lyrics all being stream memes. Then I recorded myself singing it. Then I thought to myself ""I won't share this yet. It'd be a good idea to share it when the Witcher 3 video comes out and streams come back, as a celebration"". But of course that hasn't happened yet, and streams have only come back almost a year after that. So a recording of me singing that song has been sitting on my computer this whole time. And this stupid song has been stuck in my head for almost a year. But that's not even the good part. See, when I recorded the song originally, it was around the time that I was realising that I'm transgender. I hadn't realised yet that I wanted my voice to sound different. So I had recorded myself singing it in my dead voice. Then by the time I realised that I wanted my voice to sound different, I realised that I'd have to re-record the song eventually. But changing your voice is really hard. So this became an arms race between me getting better at my new voice and Joe making the Witcher 3 video. Luckily I got comfortable with my new voice in late January of this year. (It's still not perfect. Paradoxically, it's harder to sound Female the higher pitch you talk, or sing, with.) But then obviously streams have now come back very abruptly and before the Witcher 3 video has come out, so I've had to re-record this song literally today.

||acts 5 - 7 review
the war chapter felt long but it wasn't bad, i actually kind of like it cause it felt more serious than the others, also the conversation with miriam on the club was pretty cute, i was saying to ice that the walking on walls felt a little odd at the start cause the controllers were changed but i just kept the same input after start walking it so the issue was resolved
act 6, ok, this is was the worst act for me
the snow gameplay was miserable to me, i failed so many times on some of the jumps that i actually don't know if the game wanted to be a hardcore platformer or im just bad at it, it felt pretty awful and dragged for to long tbh, the story bits were pretty good but the gameplay really killed it for me
act 7 (final act)
the conversation with mirriam at the start hit me the most cause i used to be like the bard when i was like 13-18, i used to hide my feelings because other people were having a bad time so i can understand the bard in that regard, the final fight felt weird? at least the last phase but overall it was good

now random ramble before my final review

so, i have a problem in act 6 with the bard, is a minor problem but worth nothing i guess, the bard was like ""sorry hero i will let you die here cause if not the world is going to end"" and that felt really out of character for me. mirriam has been telling the bard to stop helping people because we are getting late to save the universe while the bard is like ""but we can't let this people down!!!"" and now you are going to let her die? maybe he knew she was going to accept but it was pretty strange for the bard to say that imo. That ""bugged"" me a little ... <:joeDab:585663475850674206>

i identify somehow with the bard, i really like the character because they are really just trying their best and the world was saved just because they helped so many people during their journey, which i guess is like a double twist of thinking that helping them and the start was a bad idea. i don't know if its good to consider the spirits as pointless cause at the end you kind of use parts of the earthsong just adding the world singing? so maybe it wasn't was pointless.
i will keep the messages of ""trying your best"" from this game, those are some of the thoughts that really make me a little depress cause i don't think im doing my best really, just the past week i didn't work at all on my job lmao at the end it wasn't neccesary but still it makes me feel bad when i see the bard like ""even if you failed you tried!"" and im like ""well...i didn't even try it!"", but i guess, as the little spirit said ""baby steps first"".

man i had a lot of thoughts that were lost during the game lmao. I like the characters, the humor was great.
i think my only problem with the game is the gameplay, it goes from good (the dog boss fight) to pretty shit (the snow section), and there are more shitty sections that good ones.
the last section of the game (when you sing with the world) felt like really bad implemented, i don't know why they decided to make you do every section two times? like just one time was enough, you didn't need to repeat yourself, thats the elden ring effect.

well unless i remember something for later, yeah i can see why you like it so much <@190188039719485440> , the story is something that if it resonates with you it can be pretty impactful.

At first i thought that chicory was going to be a better version of this game, which it is on gameplay, but the story of this game is as good as chicorys in the case of its themes

It resonated with me so, so much primarily because I connected and related so much to the Bard (especially with the section you mention in Act 7), but I know that this is a game in which my personal attachment and enjoyment of it is much stronger than most. I suspect most people will have a similar opinion to you: it's a charming game with a lot of heart and some gameplay issues that is ultimately a positive experience.

Small bit of trivia I tell everyone: Act 5 (the war chapter) was originally the *entire game.* When the concept for Wandersong was being crafted, Act 5 was the entire story from which the rest of the game sprouted as mechanics, characters, and the world expanded. That's why it stands out so much among the others.

Act 6, to me, is meant to be the second valley for the Bard. In Act 4, their go-getter attitude and nativity about the truth of his mission are shattered, but their ideals and friends allow them to pick themselves up from that low point and rise again. Act 6 is desolate in comparison. The snow is back, but now it engulfs a wilderness rather than dusting a town. The threat isn't melancholy and a lack of purpose, it's a ravenous beast stalking the countryside. There is no village. There is no Miriam. There is only you, your goal, and the obstacles that lie ahead.||","",""

Upon my replaying it I didn't find it to be particularly fingerbiting - it evokes the aesthetics of Celeste, but not the challenge - but that's all down to personal experience. 

Regarding the Bard's attitude towards Audrey in Act 6: as I said, this Act is the final valley before the finale. Here, rather than Bard's naivety being shattered, their beliefs are being directly challenged. They are forced to examine what it is they need and want, and in that moment they are grappling with whether Audrey - a person who has done nothing but treat them and their friends with disrespect, significantly injured Miriam, and continues to kill Overseers despite what will happen - is really someone who can be redeemed. They have to ask themself - truly - if their personal ideology is worth the end of the world itself. That is why they treat Audrey the way they do.||","",""

 I remember the thing that I'm carrying, full of lines I'm meant to remember, and dots I'm meant to fill in. It hits the ground. I breathe out and keep moving forward.
 
 I reach the door. My hand slowly wraps around the knob, a warm embrace. I twist and pull and open it slowly. A gentle breeze keeps me moving forward.
 
 I close it shut behind my back. The air inside is black, just the way he likes it. But this time I don't think I mind. I take my shoes off as I keep moving forward.

1. If you look closely at the pattern, you'll realise it's a '9' but it's also the sign for '2' in Oriya's language.

2. It's the camera! By door two!

3. The roman numerals for the number 2, on a choker. 

4. Similar to the oriya, this is the arabic number for 2! 

5. +2 or -2, which I'm suddenly realising might be why she won.

6. cuffs. you know, cause ||its the torture room?||

7. Oh and, black/white for the top, like ||prison outfits||

Extras:
I find it hilarious <@218764427032264704>  didn't realise till I told them, the door was both the waifu _and_ the ones behind the door, have none of you seen those absolutely awful dating shows?! 

The colour pallet is based exclusively on the colours of the door.

- First part of the main piano loop is genuinely great. Later on, when you add some variance to the harmony, the lower notes become muddy. This clashing is caused by wibbly wobbly wacky sound waves overlapping each other when you play small intervals in low octaves. To circumvent this, you can change up the voicing of the chord and play some of the notes in a higher octave. 
- Sax is a wind instrument, and so the player (even if it virtual) needs to breathe. Try shortening the longest notes, and breaking up some legato parts with staccato
- Speaking of sax, there's some weird dissonance with it, as if it's a bit out of tune. It's especially apparent in the very first note.
- Overall, I like the sax melody tho, it do be good. At about 1:09 though, it's not often that a melody puts emphasis on the bebop tritone. It's not bad, I do like it, but you should probably fortify the idea a bit more.","",""

To begin with, I started trying to work in Paint 3D at the time since it was just what I had, but it's limitations became apparent when I was trying to adjust things in the frame and it would mess with the entire picture (since you can't use layers to my understanding in Paint 3D). So, from there, I learned to use GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program, completely free btw) on Kay's recommendation. It took some getting used to but I think anyone given a couple hours can understand and get familiar with the features of GIMP, at least on a basic level.

The next thing was getting a background picture from the game at a somewhat decent quality and size. If you're limited by being unable to draw and are sticking with existing pictures for the most part (luckily the Zero Escape wiki has most of the 2D character sprites), this can be kind of difficult because you need to try to get a picture that isn't too big since your sprites, in this case Akane, won't match the size of the picture and stretching the character will cause issues with resolution. If you're especially keen-eyed and compare the comic scene to the real scene, Akane is a bit smaller than her game counterpart. That was compromise between lowering the background picture's resolution by shrinking it and being forced to make Akane larger, lower her resolution. Ultimately, the picture looked good enough in my opinion to be fine with her being a little smaller, so I kept her the same size.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/978447959714857000/Showcase.PNG?ex=66985bac&is=66970a2c&hm=73536d84a2d55f21244f361c518d0a55533b9269cf1d4ca0bdb770673e8ba66b&",""
"95621043133087744","snypehunter007","2022-05-24T00:02:54.6410000+00:00","I won't touch on getting the sprites, since that goes hand-in-hand with the part above and was already partially mentioned.

From there, I had to recreate the text box and name boxes pixel by pixel, referencing the (in this case) DS version of the game. Other than just getting the dimensions mostly right, I also had to judge what was a good level to lower the opacity of, just for example, the black pixels of the text box to (I think I ended up reducing their opacity to 85 or 90%), so it can allow you to see the objects underneath the box faintly just like in game. Of course, this is all done on different layers.

For the words themselves (if you want to try to make it as accurate as possible to the DS version in this case), you're going to have to just bite the bullet and recreate them all pixel by pixel. Standard white for the letters themselves with a dark grey outline to make them pop and highlight the letters. Granted, this does get easier if you already have one letter or, as you go on, a whole word already drawn since you can just copy and paste the letter/word and make sure it lines up properly. If you're going to try to recreate the font style as well, there are multiple screenshots of scenes with text from the DS version of the game on the wiki. Reference those until you find the letter you need and then recreate it.

A sample screenshot of what this all looks like in the GIMP editor is included.","",""

I'll suggest not getting rid of the power meter when you're out of the shadows by the way. Something else that is important for Hollow Knights combat design is that after getting soul from the enemy, you can save this soul and use it in a better opportunity, giving you more agency when finding a time to heal or cast a spell.

It's Joseph ""Sun Station"" Anderson...
Well, well, well...
Let's go!

You'll soon forget... (what?)
That he's ever been gone (why?)
Cause he keeps coming back
Like that recording for Doctor Lingard

He's playing games, yup, it's for us
He guessed the plot, cogniferous
It's the Dragon's Den
With.. Mr. Anderson
Gonna be fun like the Matrix
This time for sure

with
Anderson, Jo-seph
Anderson, it's the J P H stream, baby, the
Anderson, Jo-seph
Anderson, it's the J P H stream, babyyy
 
Weeb games like ""Huh, nani?""
Why ain't ya payin' up waifu money?
Why ain't ya buyin' our statue-tory? 
But he won't be goin' for no top loli
See, he's got a type, a chanified bike
2 B fair, also Aoi for life
It's FAITOW Night
And we got lots to do
How 'bout we start a new?
Reload for Haru

One guy goes:
""Gotta go for the harem"" 
Beyond Two Holes
That's a three hoe problem
Persona 4
Not the 5th installment 
A 6/10 like the Märio game

Sippin' on tea, he ain't the Mad Hatter
Keeps trolling even through all the bad chatter 
""What happened with Yazooka?"" 
It doesn't matter
People got pissed like
urine from a bladder
Gotta brush 'em off like your teeth, mate
When you get up during the pee break
Haters among us say he's been sus
And he tricked us like a deep fake
But like sheesh, wait
Whatchu mean, mate? 
He quit Steens;Gate 
But it's been played
Like vegetables it may seem great

It's my main ""hobby"". And despite the fact that I've posted all sorts of random things here, I do consider writing to be my most developed skillset.
But some time ago, I went on a year-long hiatus because of personal reasons. And only have been focusing my efforts back on them again recently. 
So in order to regain some of that energy I had when I started, I want to recruit some people to become my reader personally and receive their thoughts.
----So if you are:
    . Already an Asian Web-novel-reading degenerate. Especially Isekais stories.
    . A massive weeb with the trashiest of tastes. (like if you literally would eat garbage for fun.)
    . A fellow amateur writer wanting to trade stories.
    . Or just generally interested in reading stuff because you have some time on your hands.
> **Since I kind of want to have a proper conversation with any potential readers, I won't be posting any links here. So if you really are interested in helping me out. Please send me a DM.**
By the way, for the genres of the two stories that I'm currently writing. One is a cutesy fantasy harem rom-com story with mystery elements, while the other is a fourth-wall-breaking high-concept Isekai.
They both use the [QCN] system as a basis. The best [Magic/Power System] in all of fiction.
To cap it off here is a drawing I made for a character in my stories a long time ago. (one of the first drawings I've ever made, actually now that I think about it.)","",""

first lets look at the odd squares, unless im missing something simpler, the minimum solution there will be eliminating its diagonal or its recombinations, so in total the amount of solutions will be n! where n is the number of rows/columns

now for the even squares, it will be enough to eliminate just 4 of the circles, as long as they cancel each other both column wise and row wise so to speak, the formula i derived is (n(n-1)/2)^2 (so for 4x4 case, (4\*3/2)^2 = 36 solutions)

for the cases where only the rows/columns are odd, the minimal solution seems to be to remove the odd one, im too lazy to derive a formula for this one for now because it gets fucky, but the upper bound is m^n where m is whatever the odd one is and n is the even one","",""

Elements like a tutorial. You never think about that when you set out to make a game. It's not sexy. Then there's gameplay. As in what i want to encourage the player to do. The specific language of my game i want to impart to the player. For instance, the sword bounce or pogo mechanic is an intrinsic part of my game. In that light, the Maggot Knight boss fight has changed. You now have to bounce on his head a bunch to stun him. Then you can go to town. https://twitter.com/iconomy/status/1526329774951518208","","ReecePog (1)"

"237753974390915072","thefuryofowls","2022-07-17T00:14:51.0500000+00:00","As far as what I did to make that Mapo Tofu, I ended up putting the following ""abnormal"" vegetables & aromatics in it:

Habaneros
Shiitake Mushrooms
Sweet Italian Peppers
Green Beans

My reasoning for each has to do with a ""default"" Mapo Tofu recipe, and how you sub things to make it vegetarian while keeping similar texture & flavour.

a baseline mapo tofu recipe normally involves:
Ground Pork (or other meat)
Tofu
Ginger + Garlic + Onions + Some sort of chili (like thai, birdseye, etc)
A ""sauce"" normally consisting of: Chili crisp, sesame oil, sichuan peppercorns, corn starch, chicken stock

So to make it vegetarian, I swapped the ground pork for some minced Shiitake mushrooms which would also help with the umami, then I used Habaneros as opposed to other chilis because I wanted to see how that turned out. From there I also just added some Sweet Italian Peppers & Green Beans for extra vegetable content in general.

Overall it turned out well, though I'd say the Habaneros were a complete waste. They didn't make the final outcome *worse* I just couldn't necessarily say I even added them specifically vs. any other chili. Given how they are more expensive than other chilis and are also more of a pain to work with I'd probably just skip them.
 (they are so much spicier that you have to be a bit careful with the oils they secrete, so you don't pepper-spray yourself by touching your face after touching them)","","ReecePog (1)"

Made it the night before because it taste s better on subsequent reheats.

Ingredients:
1kg poke belly/pork shoulder, sliced into 3cmx3cm cubes,
120ml of vinegar,
110ml of soy sauce,
4 bay leaves,
6 garlic cloves, minced,
1 tsp black peppercorns.
Water 

Steps:
Add everything but the pepper and water to a marinating bowl.
To a big pot, a layer of oil. Get some good colour on the pork pieces on high heat (you want to boil off the water on the pork so that it starts frying).
Once all the pork has gotten sufficiently browned, place it all back into the pot with the marinate mixture, adding water till the meat is submerged, and a bit more after (About half the amount of water it took to fully submerge the pork). 
Simmer for 1-2hrs, it depends on how much water boils off, how tender you want your pork, and what flavour you want in the finished Adobo. 
Usually, the longer you boil, the sweeter the stew gets and conversely it is much less acidic.

Once it's done, eat with some white rice. It's strong stuff. It'll be even tastier tmr when you go to reheat it. Refrying the pork instead of boiling it make the flavours even more complex.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1016874985517756416/20220907_001956.jpg?ex=669868a1&is=66971721&hm=6f47d2034dd685cfe6f6746115689f3007df148035406cc0a753b23a68d04eb3&","pog (12)"

Sweet core mechanic,  and the enemies do a great job of utilizing it.  I love the enemy design in this game.  There's a bunch of enemies that are interesting on their own, but then all together it makes for a strong enemy cast. 

 It's great how the second to second gameplay of this game has a lot of micro variety because of all the different situations these enemies create.    Great feeling of chaos and manipulating positioning

It's a bit frustrating to not always be 100% confident if a click is going to launch you or hit an enemy.  Missing by a couple miliimeters  is often the difference between hurting an enemy and dying. There's also a lot that can happen during the ""oh no second"" after you launch somewhere.  I think strategically it's highly encouraged to make mostly small jumps, but I consider it more fun to make longer jumps.  I think some kind of tongue-cancelling action you can do could be pretty good.

Finally the parry mechanic rules and the art is pretty cute <:AYAYA:563896384613515264>","",""

Once they cooled I tried a few slices, overall it is tasty and definitely is chocolaty, but I also think it's almost too... Fluffy?

Like it feels like it could be more intensely flavourful if I didn't use as much flour (which I suppose makes it a proper cake vs say, brownies)

Ingredients:
Bread Flour - 600 grams 
Salt - 10 grams
Instant Yeast - 10 grams (my yeast was weak today)
Water - enough to hydrate the dough, not a dry dough)
Olive oil - enough for covering the pan, the top of the foccacia, and the bowl to use for rising.
Garlic - 3 cloves
Rosemary - 3 stalks

Make sure to incorporate the flour and salt together before adding the yeast. 
Add water till the dough is hydrated.
Knead till it can be formed into a smooth ball.
Leave it in a well oiled bowl to rest and rise. Punch it down and let it rise again. (This step will depend on your room temperature, and or if you placed the dough in the fridge. I placed mine in the fridge overnight and let is rise again for half a day).
Place dough in a well oiled pan.
Spread it out on the pan. (The dough may resist. If it does, do not stretch it forcefully, let it rest for 10 mins between pulls untilt the bread fits the pan completely). 
Dimple the dough. (Use your fingers and press into the dough, liberally stabbing it with your fingers to create craters).
Add garlic rosemary oil to the top.
Place in oven at 230 degrees.
Take out once the top is golden. (My oven is uneven af which is why there are overcharred regions).
Or 25 mins.
Let it rest 30 mins.
Enjoy.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1027945331654131733/20221007_213700.jpg?ex=669878f1&is=66972771&hm=ffa3920a78b5e42dafefd352f779c79b961d3f577803d9c7495b69b8ab65ba02&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1027945332283281418/20221007_220732.jpg?ex=669878f1&is=66972771&hm=9b62d93ffed31b2cca26dd382907dfe9c393f7c453f081d59b2546435f35ec74&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1027945332778225755/20221007_220848.jpg?ex=669878f1&is=66972771&hm=a104d17f1e272334727b5377271e21859c60fd67beddfc5563c3f16c3433eb0e&","pog (9)"

This is the card that will fade-in/fade-out during the Bestiary part of the video, showcasing the enemy, and some tidbits about fighting them. 
I'm mostly looking for Feedback on a few things:
A) Should the Lanterns have a Magenta Outline as well? They kinda blend into the background when layered over the Footage. 
B) Is the stark Black too much contrast? I've been thinking a dark grey might fair better. 
C) The image seems to be kinda eye-blazing when layered over the Footage, so I'm thinking I may have to mess with the Brightness or Contrast a bit.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1044772414883635301/TAKE_2_POST_MERGE_PNG.png?ex=669862a2&is=66971122&hm=71823c0e7a319a922b7ee722392db7418e01c055b4891e72708fa1678050542c&",""

rule of thumb I guess would be how fast the object curves, like fingers are actually fairly block'y so the shadow on them would be relatively hard
sphere would have a soft shadow, but even soft shadows usually have an edge, so you can somewhat tell where it's light and where is shadow, if that makes sense
I think hard shadows are generally harder to mess up, I think? so they might be safer if you just don't know
drop shadows, like shadows caused by the head on the herdier, would usually be sharp because the object causing them is close","",""

To my mind the one problem is that this doesn't elaborate much on the Title, ""Why Nostalgia is a Killer"" and I feel it could lead to a deeper conversation about how Nostalgia being a factor in games discussion is definitely something that SHOULD be brought up more often (consider Joe, and how Chrono Trigger is is favorite game.)
But to me, this video is a work of video-game inspired Poetry, about the nature of Nostalgia, and wanting to return to a simple time, but knowing that you never can and that all you can ever do is remind yourself of the past, but never return to it. (I feel the same way about Thousand Year Door and other titles)
But, if you view it as a piece of Video Game inspired Poetry, this video is excellent. Definitely enjoyed it.","","👍🏻 (1)"

I still have alot of pre-development work to do, but I'm really looking forward to the process. I genuinely just love what I do.

There's plans for 3d modeling for the environments, quite a few concept ideas for side characters (Specifically I'm planning three musicians and either 2 or 3 stage hands) The only thing that I'm not doing is the music which I'm just going to use the original track. I literally would have done it myself if uh, I had a convincing deeper tenor like I used to.

I know it's not exactly how you're supposed to do the base character sheet but eh it's my work, my decision. I'm pretty happy with the updates to the designs, I made some changes to Kai's original design because when I was done with Afi's, it didn't look like they matched, but now I'm quite happy with it. Especially like that the symbol they share has an inverted pallet. It looks really nice to me. 

Also added my notes on the fashion details, you can see some of them say ""[F-0]"" at the end, which is supposed to be figure 1. 2. 3. etc. But I need to compile my references into the design document and I'm too tired and sick to continue today.

So I’m going with a mixture of 1940s maid + casual apparel on her design, maid cause, y’know. Dryer. Hence the cleaning gloves and the apron. 

I expanded a bit on my original design, specifically I just, floofed (for a lack of a better term) the hair, because I don’t know if I said this in jads when I made the first version, but her hair is supposed to give “air” like textures. I also accentuated the ‘bangs’ of her hair to apply to that.

I do like the short skirt for her, I feel like it fits a very like, bubbly persona.  But I wonder if the dryer concept works better with a long skirt, specifically I was thinking bustled skirt which is my spin on the original 1940s design of the apron. (Example of a Bustled Skirt: <https://www.myfashiongalore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twill-Bustle-Skirt.jpg>) 

I also was wondering if her gloves and pockets should be coloured, like one purple and one orange or should her “self” (excluding the clothes in the hair) just have colour inside the window

- Inside of the pockets, gloves, cape, skirt is a dark grey-blue inlining, mostly to make it pop out. 

- The joint 'screws' are orange

- The underside of the baby doll shoes are purple (that's the name of the style for anyone who needs reference, specifically '1940s baby doll shoes w/ two inch heel' is how i'd describe it.) In the actual sheet I'll draw the shoes properly so you can see the purple but if you need a visiulization, look at the iconic red bottom  louis vuitton heels. imagine that with the baby doll shoes but purple.

Was originally a train powered by a winding mechanism and elastic, but the latter degraded.
Still having electronics from way-back-then, decided to swap out the mechanism with an electric (stepper) motor.

Pretty happy with the code side.
Motor is still too weak to drive, but I'm getting a stronger battery next week so fingers crossed that'll be enough. (we're at ~8V right now, and worried that 12V will heat it up too much).

Also got to finally have a reason to get into OpenSCAD to design some of my own parts to 3d-print. The blue casing in the cabin for the motor, and some track based on those that came with the build set so I've something to ride on.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1058750000756166676/20221229_234620.mp4?ex=66987a86&is=66972906&hm=7c1b3e076c23d6c92f5fa1d887d90735e7f8d2e87c59097c7e7fc0b2d48bb3a1&","pog (11)"

Since the turn radius of the train is about 1.8 meters, I don't have space for a loop. So I'll be putting 2 distance sensors on the back/front that allows it to move back and forth over a piece of rail.

If the motor allows, I'd love to buy and assemble one or two of the carriages for the train to attach.","",""

Looking for: 
- 2D Artist(s) who can create and animate characters
- Sound & Music Designer(s) (found them!)

We're looking for artists to create a 2D action roguelite with an ""easy to play but hard to master"" combat system. The game will be heavily inspired by beat'em ups, fighting games, roguelites (Streets of Rage, Hades).
We already have a playable prototype of the game. All assets (as well as the artstyle and the visual theme) are placeholders. Artists coming to the project will be welcome to choose a comfortable artstyle and a visual/musical theme.

See the gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmpEDIs05pc
Play the prototype here: https://holden22.itch.io/infernalis-prototype

Our team: Two professional programmers/designers
Engine: Unity
Length of project: Probably 6 months to a year.
Goal: Finishing the project. Possibly releasing on Steam and sharing revenue.

Status: Open 

Contact: DM cashews#2913 or Holden#3594 on Discord. A small message about yourself and your experience and portfolio would be greatly appreciated.","","weebey (7)"

-AI art is not allowed in this channel for the time being, it seems the de-facto channel for that is <#666328839114326026> so you can still post there.
-""Simple"" Food prep updates aren't allowed in this channel, however anything on the more complex side is perfectly fine and welcome (Think about simple ""I made this for breakfast"" vs ""I made this decorative cake""). 
-There has been more conversation than usual in this channel recently so we would like to ask that conversation is moved to another channel instead to avoid someone's work being buried.
Sorry for any inconvenience caused by the recent changes, feedback is always welcome.","","👍 (8)"

Low effort posting like posting your ramen bowl. (Though there are ways to make it look complex: Garnishing helps, but the way you cut your granishing also changes the visual complexity of the dish. Easy toppings on add colour to the bowl: corn, seaweed, fishcake, egg. The lighting of the shot and angle from the food helps separate a meal from a *meal* )

One side is homemade guacamole, other side is greek yoghurt (cause I ran out of creme freche) with a strip of sriracha in the middle. Topped with corn and two slices of pan fried spam.

1. You have csp v1, you can keep using it freely and they'll keep supporting it for a while
2. You can buy v2, or for cheaper upgrade to it from v1 and it'll be standalone version free to use,but you will not get v2.0 feature updates, it'll just be v2.0
3. If you have any standalone version of csp, you can get ""update pass"" which is basically subscription that gives you any future updates but cheaper, and if you stop it you'll be rolled back to whatever standalone version of csp you have
4. You do not have a csp and you get a subscription, you'll get the latest version with all features, it's more expensive than update pass since u can get it without having bought csp, and if u stop paying it you can't use csp anymore

(Sung to the 1967 Spider-Man Theme by Paul Francis Webster and Bob Harris)

Trolley-chan, Trolley-chan
Does so more than a trolley can
Stops a train, any size
Gives off big Danganronpa vibes
Look out
Here comes our Trolley-chan

Is she strong?
Listen, weeb
She launched Joe at a shocking speed
Can she fit through a door?
Grav-gun-chan will help her explore
Hey, there
There goes our Trolley-chan

In rivers so tight
Under threat of Combine
With new tech and might
She swims through on a dime

Trolley-chan, Trolley-chan
Friendly Joseph stream Trolley-chan
Memes and fame
She's ignored
Fan art is her reward
To her
Half-Life's a great big bang up
Whenever there's a hang up
You'll find our Trolley-chan","","cap (2)"

This isn't a rulebook. It's a short document meant for game designers or players to read. Mainly to show my work on the game. I'd also like to link it in my  portfolio.

If you have a few minutes to skim through it (esp. if you play other card games), I'd really appreciate your feedback!

'Discerning what constitutes as “fairness” in video game design and how it makes for a more fun experience.'
I'm hoping to collect some survey results from people that have played the game to use in my report on the subject. If you're interested, the link to the game is below, and the survey can be found on the game's page. If you have ~30 mins to spare and try out the game + do the survey it would help me out a lot!
If you decide to try it out, please play Version B of the game. While playing the game there will be an option in the menu to alter the difficulty to your liking. Please do so and keep track of what your settings were by the end of the playthrough. There are more details on the game page.
Thanks!

> She sometimes misses,
> His hoarse silhouette,
> His silt and green algae,
> His turbid translucence,
> His clumsy courtship:
> ""Croak""
> 
> He sometimes ponders,
> His own rhythmic cadence,
> His own broad smile,
> His own delicate body language,
> Whether appropriate:

> At the bottom of a pond so empty, the concept of emptiness vanishes, 
> A chill resembling that of dark matter permeates. 
> Floating microbes coagulate beyond his sight,
> He's perplexed and puzzled,
> Wondering where his voracity comes from.

1. Use a thick brush (30pixels) to vaguely feel your way through her anatomy <:SaberBlush:587084335337701380> 
2. Then with the same brush but this time use the ""eraser mode"" to thin the line out. I think the shortcut is R on krita. Or E? I forgot since I've changed my keybinds.
3. Use step 1 and 2 again for details like hair or clothings, but this time use a slightly thinner brush (about 20-25 pixels)
4. You can use ONE layer for all this if you want!

I'm currently making a Danganronpa™ fangame. I've recently finished writing and editing the script. So I'm looking for people to beta-read it. 
I thought this might actually be not a bad place for that since Joe has covered all mainline games and even, God forbid, 3 anime. So, I'd only recommend reading quick summary about Danganronpa 0 novel to get all the references in my work. Also, there are a couple references only Joe's watchers will get (added since the streams introduced me to the franchise).
So PM me if you're interested.","",""

My general advice there would be, unless you intend to let the player do massive sequence breaks (I.E. flying past an entire level), figure out where you wanna define ""boundaries"" between portions of playable content, and make whatever loading in you need to do happen once the player reaches past those points. That way you know for sure when you'll need to spool in new content at full level of detail, and it'll also be easier to judge how much lower LOD content you'll need in the distance.","",""

If they're going fast enough then there's the potential for them to fly through unloaded geometry though, so you'd either want to somehow keep the level collision separate from the assets so you can have that loaded in at all times (difficult to think of an easy way to do this in Unity without maybe building custom editor tooling), or if the player's going fast enough, just do what BOTW does and pause the game while you wait for stuff to load in.","","👍 (1)"

Now, I'm not a poet nor songwriter, but I *do* write as a hobby and am currently studying rhetoric in college, so I have gained a certain proficiency in painting imagery.

Generally, I'm lazy in writing. I let the audience do most of the image painting by using conjuncted, yet open-ended sentences because the reader paints their own best image (it's similar to how people imagine the worst from the unknown). Not so conjuncted to be annoying and unworkable, but not too precise as to limit imagination. People like using their imagination's, why not harness that? Here's a quick edit of paragraph 3.

'I'm outside of my head
Chrome-clad, plugged in
Eyes glazed over
Dead cells, no charge
No reveille, shut me down'

While structurally very similar, cutting out alot of the ""fat"" lends itself to more vivid imagery in the readers mind. It's not perfect, I'd probably replace 'reveille' with a less obtuse word (it should still be a flowery word evoking a failure to heal or recover, but reveille is too angelic sounding), and alter the structure it sound less ""slam poetry"", but like I said I'm a lazy writer, I'd deal with it later.

TL;DR not cring very nice ebic poem","",""

I gotta say, of all the worlds that I've faffed around in, *Starfield's*™️  world is definitely the most fun one I've ever experienced! The worlds are so detailed and full of life. There's just so much impressive and innovative technology on display in this game. I didn't think that Todd Howard would be able to surpass his work in Fallout 4, but he did! This is easily game of the year for me, and I'm sure it'll be for you too if you give it a chance and purchase the Digital Premium Edition, which will give you access to the game before it officially releases.

A world-famous Twitch user ChimerasNotGoats once said, ""We should play ""Rabi-Ribi chat message"" or ""Dujanah chat message"". So today we're going to be doing exactly that! I have picked Amazing Cool Very Awesome Quotes from both Rabi-Ribi's and Dujanah's Twitch chats to create the Hardest Guessing Game Ever. This is like ""Pie or Anus"", but you get Anus every other turn.
What's the prize for completing this trial? More quotes, of course -- each result description but one includes a score and a very special quote that is bound to make you laugh and/or get me in someone's blocklist! (but genuinely, if you want your quote to be removed, please DM me, hopehajime).

This is all the material that i've made for the game (graphics, sprites and 3d models), there is also some animation sprites i've made for slime enemies but i decided not to put it here. 

It was going to be a 2.5D game about a mage alchemist that is trying to make a potion that turns things into gold and thinks that your old one is not being very useful for it so you go on a journey to find the perfect cauldron.

- The inventory icon was the first asset I made and was a quick placeholder I made while getting the engine up and running. It turned out so good that it's easily the best sprite I drew for the whole game (that's not saying much). 
- The bar was one of the last backgrounds I made and the best in my opinion.
- The JomsQuest Theme that plays for the majority of game I made last minute after toying around with a bunch of different ideas. I originally envisioned having a polka-y tune in the style of banjo kazooie but I couldnt make it work. You can kind of hear that original intent with the marimbas in the tune I went for. I feel the bossa nova vibes really complimented the overal tone of the game. Had I more time, expanding this would've been one of my main priorities.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1153041948018491534/bar.png?ex=669813fe&is=6696c27e&hm=b232a9f6c54cabfdb5725572a6d099d1fc986dbe87a6df8108087a681d5771a5&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1153041948375003247/Bag.png?ex=669813fe&is=6696c27e&hm=5c3a64da4ebb7f0b01b7a97ce44c9577eb811929377472feb313f3ab2ecb52b7&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1153041948572127342/JomsSong.wav?ex=669813ff&is=6696c27f&hm=0ccbd8f24d6983d43793f88b47de3f3a34b798d9b17def223d0f7d0cee4c3adc&","pog (4),Jomseph (2)"

The Alkary, The first of several unarmed sea level observation ships put into service by the Broadheart in an attempt to silently observe hunting squadron activity near Surface airbases. This Airmarine is only capable of low altitude aerostatic flight and thus uses stubby wings to gain the bit of lift it needs for sea-level cruising. 

As the ship's design and assembly was a joint operation between several companies, most notably Rigband Motors and Silvercrown Ltd, it comes equipped with a variety of interesting engines and radar systems. Powered by a Silvercrown TS-39 turboprop cruise engine (outputting 9800 Shaft horsepower), the ship can keep flying for a long while before needing to refuel, and in case of an intercept it can use it's two custom tuned Rigband Alco afterburning turbojets to rapidly dive away from danger. 

For observation and reconassiance the Alkary is equipped with an early variant of the ""Slava"" search radar (Reporting name - Clipper Horn) which has four large rod like recievers set behind the cockpit and a characteristic circular signal control disc on the radome's front spike, from which the ship got it's name. the control disc is lost on all subsequent SLO ships as it was moved inside of the radome.  Besides the search radar the ship is also equipped with a SP-2-200 weather radar (RN - Ankh Boost) on the cockpit's chin and a ""Kormoran"" Conarm Field Monitor Early Answer Device (RN - Shifter Fork) mounted onto fixed moustache canards.

I think I missed another idea for joke there), so maybe kinda spoiler-ish? Nothing major though and the game is like from 2010 but you do you. Also the whole first fanart attempt was a disaster from the start. I have some art background, bought a cheap tablet on a whim long time ago and tried it once or twice, nothing big, decided that ""This  time for sure!"", failed miserably, everything is hard and clunky to me and uncomfortable, dropped the idea and decided to stick with the old ways. Massive respect to everyone who draws digital. Also I found this Witcher 3 logo and thought it looks like an S, so there, I hope the joke works.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1165993752050028625/madskilsfanart.png?ex=6698650d&is=6697138d&hm=359faf52b37fa2109d4b3b0b3c2630691162c35d88b3c564faf2356c9ec0b978&","JoePoint (6)"

Deciding the colors and the style was a giant pain in this one. At first I wanted to render everyone as they appeared in their games, but was too afraid that the realism and the more cartoony art styles would clash too much or be incoherent. Then I wanted them all to have a comic book-esque style, but it fit some characters TOO well and drew focus away from the ones it didn't fit. In the end I just went for something simpler in order to ensure everyone blended in fairly well with each other, it kind of feels like a cop out tbh, but I don't think I would be able to make the whole piece balanced otherwise. 2023 was an amazing year for gaming imo, and I really wanted something to commemorate it before I yell at the game awards for my games not winning at any of the categories. Seriously if Hi-Fi Rush doesn't win best sound design there's gonna be a riot in this room.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1181390123879895110/2023.png?ex=6698604a&is=66970eca&hm=ce3f5b722d032aa752530a9a7196cef26dc753620f00b8725fb91fc8fbae0133&","pog (25),💙 (2)"

Its original concept, impeccable pacing, and masterfully foreshadowed narrative deserve to be celebrated. The game comes together into a wholly idiosyncratic experience through its many distinct and memorable characters that all feel like they belong in the world; multiple intersecting plotlines that return and resolve in surprising ways; and an ever-increasing list of mysteries that the game manages to wrap up in the end. It balances light-hearted moments with an impressive emotional core for its characters. And it does all that in a dozen hours. However, Ghost Trick's narrative isn't just a satisfying story that is enjoyable as a traditional mystery; it's a cohesive work that works best as an interactive experience. Both the gameplay and story are constrained by the same rules that govern Ghost Trick's universe, ensuring that both aspects are tightly interwoven and mutually beneficial. Both gameplay and story are further expertly realized through the game's presentational style. The deliberate theatrical perspective mimics the sensation of sitting in an audience and looking into the world that is unfolding on stage, as if we are an outside force looking into the world of the living. This theatrical perspective is effectively used to allow the characters to flourish on screen, while simultaneously building suspense, and ingeniously obscuring the mystery right in front of our eyes. Going back and seeing all the immaculate foreshadowing you inevitably missed your first time through makes this a story that you can appreciate even more on a second playthrough. I was very happy to see that the story still held up as a one-of-a-kind narrative that doesn't outstay its welcome after all these years; a story - its soul revived over a decade later - which continues to change the fates of those that cross paths with it.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666328917237563419/1181919974701416488/GT_JADSEYA.png?ex=66985380&is=66970200&hm=27508a4c25e135249e1ddd0f543fd7ac5e254829b0ec6c2b6db88fcc0149be41&","pog (13),weebey (5),HeinzGate (6)"
