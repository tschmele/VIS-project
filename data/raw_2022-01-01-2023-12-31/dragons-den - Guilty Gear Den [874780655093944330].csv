if you want to get better, you have to actively think about getting better, you need to recognize by yourself or with someone what youre doing wrong, how to fix it and if you CAN EVEN fix it

if you say you have a ""slow brain"" and ""shit reactions"" then i believe you and I bet you do have slow brain and shit reactions, so what? you either get faster, burn in muscle memory, or formulate better strategies and knowledge that makes it so you put reactions to minimum

people don't like this opinion because everyone wants to be a ""sajam guy"" but strive is a game where you can lose, without it being your fault. that's just how explosive, unpredictable and momentum based strive is, you have to play with hand you're dealt, you cant play poker and be mad at your opponent for drawing ace, beating your queen, you lost, best thing you can do is think about what you couldve done 10 steps back

and when i say you can lose without it being your fault, i mean, sometimes you do the best thing you can do in a certain situation but still lose an interaction because your opponent was an unhinged maniac with no regard for their own safety (like me <:CANTWAKEUP:367778539623153665>), and just did something that beat your best option, there is nothing to cry about by saying how stupid you are, you just did the best thing you know, so i'd say, it wasn't even your fault, you just got RPS'd

if i get mixed, i don't care anymore, it just happened, sometimes i react and respond, sometimes I don't, and i get hit, if i think about it I'll get out of mood and lose because if you have a loser's attitude, you will be a loser

and it's pretty funny that when I try to help them improve, I force them to play another character they know, and when they aren't able to just grind someone into paste with offensive pressure, they have no clue what to do on defense.

They are one of those ""i will use literally all my resources to keep you from going on offense"" players, so when they aren't able to just ram-pressure people to death, they fall apart. This is also hampered by Ram-offense actually keeping them from learning things like conditioning, playing-reactively, etc. since Ram doesn't necessarily need to do that much (similar to HC and Nago in that way)

They've gotten better recently, but it's definitely wild how HC, Nago, Ram (and to a lesser extent Testament & Axl) train players to do defense by simply avoiding doing it altogether and focusing exclusively on running a really tight offense + neutral (often helped by those characters having some extreme ""i win neutral"" tools)","",""

-i'm gonna pretend like PRC doesn't exist here to simplify

let's say you play as sol, your main combo is : Cs -> delay Fs -> 5h -> 236 K -> K
but Cs -> Fs -> 5H -> 236 P is also your main pressure on block
-so the first idea is that it doesn't matter on the input, if you get a combo or a block you do the same thing you just have to think about the delay and whats special you do at the end (236P vs 236k)

-more advanced :

whenever you press *anything* you are locked into the animation of that thing (like i said no prc here)
so for a short while, you have *nothing* to do input wise, you can instead put all your concentration in looking at the situation, look at the range, the animation, life bar, your meter , wall health, everything that can influence your next decision,  when you do that hit confirming it just a matter of looking at the screen at the right time
