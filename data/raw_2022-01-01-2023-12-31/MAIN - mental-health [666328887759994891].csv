Take this opportunity to take stock of everything thats going wrong in your life and one step you can take to make it better. Even if its not a total solution,  a small step towards a better life is better than doing nothing. The person best equipped to help you is yourself, and don't forget that!","","joeHeart (19)"

Breaking a habit is an especially difficult thing to do, even moreso if you're just trying to quit something outright. Something that may help you in breaking this would be to try and replace smoking with some other activity. Getting your brain to stop doing something entirely can be really difficult, as it likes to stick to established patterns when it sees no reason not to. See if there's some other activity you can engage with whenever you feel the urge to smoke; something like going for a short walk or even just getting yourself a glass of water. It might not sound very enticing on paper, but it tends to be easier to replace habits than to eliminate them entirely. See what works for you.

Either way, diligence is key. People often say that it takes two weeks to form a habit, so try to use that (or a similar timeframe) as your baseline goal to work towards. Know that it's okay to falter or make mistakes. No one gets it right on the first try, especially with something difficult like this. You might end up smoking here and there throughout the year, and it's crucial that you be kind to yourself in the event that it does happen. You aren't perfect, but what matters is the effort and the intent. The most important thing is to remember what you want and why you want it. You can do this!","",""

Weird how the body reacts when it doesn't get something that it craves, material or otherwise. Clearing your house of all your weed is definitely a smart move! Like you said, relapsing would take a lot more effort with that taken care of, so that gives you a decent bit of room to question things and reassess your needs if the ""need"" to smoke appears.

Getting over that withdrawal hump is gonna be rough, but I'm sure you can do it. Stay strong, stay vigilant, and stay healthy. Making sure to drink enough water and eat at least one good meal a day can do a lot for combatting those negative symptoms and feelings.","","ü•∞ (1)"

HR exists to protect the company, which is important to remember, but they will often be the only real protection you will have. Going to a trusted manager is a good idea, but they might refer you to HR anyway. Sexual harassment doesn't stop. If you remain silent about it, the harrasers can get emboldened by it. It requires a lot of bravery and fortitude to stand up for yourself, but usually you arent alone in this case. Sexual harassers tend to harass multiple people, so the harassment will continue on to affect someone else, or has affected people previously. My ex was constantly sexually harrassed by a coworker, and it took until he locked her in a closet with him for her to speak out about it. I understand the situation you are in and I worry that your exam preparation will take a hit as this harrasement and stress continues. I know there's no easy solution in this case, but I believe in you.","",""

My parents didn't help me either, tough life.""
I knew that she wouldn't be able to considering our situation, but it still hurt. Of course she was drunk. It was very narcissistic of her.
A few minutes before, she was complaining to a friend of hers, how hard this all is to her.
She's always been this way. It's disgusting, and sad at the same time. It's clear she can't face herself, take any criticism at all, and is traumatized. This is her way of ""coping"". 

She then told me that once I earn my own money, she won't care.
I didn't like what she told me, and (even when I knew I should do it, while she's like this) I told her to stop getting drunk every day and smoking 2 packs a day, and maybe our expeses will be more manageable. My sis joined up and said ""find a job yourself. Stop being a sorry drunk!""

I knew this was way over the line.
Mom reacted very emotionally and said some mean things. 
Sis doubled down with ""do you want to end up like father?"".

Mom said: ""Yes, I want to DIE the way father did"".

She's been suicidal, self absorbed and destructive for a long time, this was just a reminder that things are indeed alarming.

I dont have any universal answers or solutions as relationships are pretty nebulous, but your feelings matter and are important. It is pretty scary and uncertain time in the world right now, and the past few years has messed with a lot of our relationships and our needs. Maintaining a relationship is tough and everything else happening certainly doesnt help. My go to reminder in relationships is that the other person often wants the best for us, as we often want the best for them, and so suffering in silence hurts both of us. Focusing on yourself is important. If you give up too much of yourself for someone else, you'll drown in a sea of uncertainty where there is never enough of yourself to give, or worse yet, eventually giving yourself doesnt work as well as it used to when you started. I regret not sticking up for myself, my own issues, my fears, and my struggles to appease and comfort my previous significant others because those issues festered and ate at me until it was too late. You have to be brave to love, and braver yet to acknowledge something is wrong. I know it isnt much, but you'll always have people here who believe in you and support you.","",""

It took me until relatively recently to even realize that I was still mentally trying to compare to her. That I was still trying to impress her, or spite her in some way. It's a difficult thing to come to grips with, and I'm still struggling to break free of it myself.

To be entirely blunt, living by someone else's metric is unsustainable. I learned a long time ago that I didn't have any idea what was going on in other people's heads, and - as an extension of that - that I should have no way of knowing what would really impress or surprise someone else. The only things I can know for certain are the things that I decide on.

In your case, there's no proper way that you can measure yourself against her in terms of success. There are degrees to these sorts of things, and perception and direction are often the deciding factors in determining whether any path or action is successful or not. Sure, she may be on her way to a PhD, but a PhD is a only measure of specific academic merit. It may be touted as some large thing - the final culmination of years of study and academia - but outside of the purpose where it was meant to benefit someone, all it really means is that that person knows a lot about a specific subject. Intelligence, particularly intelligence gained from schooling, is only as good as the circumstances in which it can be applied.

To that end, I'd encourage you to question the merit of comparing yourself to her. People's brain default to the path of least resistance in most cases, and so if the brain sees no reason to really reconsider a habit or thought that it decides is fundamental to your functioning, it won't do so. I'm not saying that you'll find the answers immediately or that you'll be a changed man if and when you do, but questioning something is a core step in affirming knowledge about yourself and the world around you. Examine your feelings, good and bad, and ask yourself where they come from and why they surface. 

Know that things will get better. Good and bad times come and go all the same, and just as the bad times before have gone away, so too will this one. It's not a matter of ""if,"" it's only a matter of when. I hope it comes soon for you.","",""

Been a couple days since I sent my whole message and I figured I'd give an update considering how... not great things sounded last time. Don't want anyone who read my whole vent paragraph to think I was still in dire straights, plus - as always - getting my thoughts out of my brain and onto a page helps a lot.

So, first things first. I'm doing better. Not a considerable amount better, at least not consistently, but I'm nowhere near as anxious and panicked as I was when I sent that message. Obviously, I was the the throes of a little anxiety attack back then, and now that it's passed things aren't quite so cataclysmic. Long story short: time, as per usual, heals all wounds.

Today in particular got a lot better. Like I said in that other message, I worry a lot about whether I was the ""bad guy"" in the relationship. Whether I was abusive, and whether or not I've left my previous partner with any lasting harm. Generally speaking, ideas like that weigh heavily on me no matter what sort of situation it is. I always wonder if I've done enough, or if I'll leave positivity in my wake. Hell, when my first dog died in 2019, I was horrified by the idea that I hadn't done enough for her. That I didn't walk her enough, or play with her enough, or any number of things. The idea that I could've done more good and didn't terrifies me.","",""

I feel worse off in a lot of ways, and better off in some as well. Worse off, primarily due to the number of personal insecurities that have been emphasized by the way the relationship ended, and better off, primarily because the seperation itself forced me to undergo a great deal of personal growth that I continue to benefit from to this day.

I'm still scared that I truly was abusive. The idea itself makes my chest tight, but the biggest problem for me in the present is wondering what truly believing that information would do for me. If I was abusive, it's not like I can do anything about it to help *her,* right? Regardless of where the blame lies, in equally powerless to make any active decisions on the matter. All I can do right now is organize my thoughts and feelings.

So, the reason why today was a good day for me is this: I remembered an important phrase which helped me grow a spine during the explosive end of the relationship to begin with. It's... not exactly a great thing to think about at face value, but I feel that it's something I have power over and that gives me power in a sense. After I cut contact with my ex, I was talking to a mutual friend of ours about the whole ordeal. I'd taken a big step in stepping away, and so obviously I was full of regrets about potential ""what ifs."" That said, this friend told me they had something they needed to tell me. Something my ex had said to them that they had sincerely regretted not telling me, and wished to do so now that they had ample reason. 

They said that my ex told them: ""I'm only in this relationship out of convenience. I'm really only sticking around until something better comes along.""

Shitty words from a shitty person. They should make me feel awful, but from the first time I ever heard them, all they made me feel was secure. Strong. Those horrible, awful words let me know that, despite all of my doubts, there wasn't a damn chance in the world I'd done the wrong thing by cutting her out of my life. However things had gone down, I could be secure in the knowledge that, at the very least, I never said or even thought anything as despicable as that about her.

And just today, I remembered that phrase. And as shitty as that phrase is - as dehumanizing and humiliating as it should be - it made me feel strong.","",""

How others perceive you can give you insight into how they perceive the world as a whole rather than how the world actually is. When you hear something that is hurtful towards you - demoralizing, humiliating, depressing, infuriating - always consider the source.

I have known a lot of people who could be considered bad, and some simply don't think the things they do are wrong, some think everyone around them is shitty too, that's  the neutral. And some do have the heartache, just not enough I guess.
I understand true loneliness can be difficult to deal with, but solitude is not something inherently bad or self-damaging, whereas these actions you regret already will harm probably harm your psyche in the future and not only today. I can't control your life, so please be careful for that. People usually suggest ways to make friends here, I never use those ways so I won't suggest them to you, you probably already know them anyway.
More importantly, I am sorry about your lack of self-love or respect. When I was having these types issues, and not saying I don't anymore, I try to remember the things I know I am good at, I know I have been appreciated at, the times I have been a decent person etc. I have a feeling you might answer this with, ""I don't have something like that,"" but I wouldn't believe you. Ask yourself if you are saying that because you lack faith in yourself or if you actually believe that. If you actually do believe it, then you need to do some discovering, because everyone is good at something. I remember always analysing the things I did and art I consumed to understand what I like, what I don't like and the reasons behind it. This helped me understand myself better in the process as well.
I truly hope you can find and befriend people you respect. I know the importance of friends, and I can't act like life is just fine without them. Good luck out there.","",""

I didn't even hear any ramblings at all. I am the only not invited who also was not busy, and I don't even know why. I am in good standing with everyone there, especially the birthday girl, at least I thought. I celebrated her birthday with a text and told her that in case it was a surprise and she didn't know, I wasn't asked and that's why I didn't show up. She told me it wasn't and thanked me. I was feeling just okay until I saw the pictures. Fucking hell. Obviously she has a right to invite whoever etc. but I really thought we were good friends so randomly being shuffled aside makes me feel like a piece of shit. I don't even know what I did. I can't and won't ask her now when she is literally celebrating, and asking anyone also feels stupid. 
I shouldn't even care, but I do. I need to stop defining my worth with my friends and how much they care. But I can't. I do this with all of them too (except the oldest ones), we hang out, I go home and boom ""This is the one they hate me for, this is the end."" I got ghosted hard by a friend a few years back right after we met up and that's where that stems from even after we made up. I even do this with JADS and it is so dumb.
Whatever. If something happened it will be revealed later. I have someone I trust, maybe I will ask her.

My only close friend wasn't, in retrospect, the best kind of guy; he always looked down on me and berated me for trivial reasons. Example of this is I get very easily startled. Whenever we played something and I shrieked, he would stop and give me the ""...come on"" type look. He made me feel like it was wrong of me to be myself and would often weasel out of meeting me by saying he was busy.

Everyone will cope with these issues in a different way, of course, but the way I looked at my situation was: I need to find a way to be happy with myself. I knew if I had that (love myself & love what I do), then I could share my perspective & my outlook on life, without having to worry I'm doing something wrong. Sometimes I can see my friends on Twitter complaining that their last raid in *FFXIV* went poorly and I just reach out to them and try to cheer them up. Or even reach out to strangers and say something nice to them. More often than not they end up going, 'cool thanks bye', but some of them were genuinely thankful, and even supported me on Patreon. 

I just know, deep inside my heart, that that's the right thing to do. And I know it's possible because I bid my toxic friend good-bye and developed my own sense of worth and purpose. 

Having a journal where I write down what I do, every day, has helped me a great deal. That way I'm not paranoid that my time & my youth is slipping through my fingers. I know I want every day of my life to be a building block of something awesome, which in my case was art. Every once in a while, I've this voice in my head telling me, ""yo, this isn't working out and I'm sick of this"", but that's a sign I've to take time off and look back at the last 1-2 months of my life. 

Hope this helps <:hugs2:920804122763071488>","",""

To balance your responsibilities out, I think planning is a crucial skill to develop. As an artist, I never work without a timer running in the background, so I can segue my daily activities (work->clean up->work->work->rest->work->talk to friends...). Remember that a small change in perspective, such as taking a break, is often the most beneficial thing you can do.

Thanks for sharing your story. As someone who's had her relatives berate her *constantly* about dropping out of the university in favor of pursuing artistic career, I know what you mean. I've had days when the echo of 'have I made the right decision?' weighed me down to the point of panic attacks.

Don't feel too bad about failing <:hugs3:920794713286660117>  Every single person worth admiring has made thousands upon thousands of mistakes. And you most certainly still have plenty of time to learn from yours. Being afraid to fail is far worse than failing. (*Or, to quote Jinx: ""what's the worst that could happen?""*)

Being indecisive is, frankly, kind of a problem for me as well. Yes, it's good to have the habit of committing to something without looking back. But on the other hand, it manifests your tendency to stop and think things through. Surely that's better than making half baked decisions.

When it comes to relationships, try not to think about it as ""I can't be liked as more than a friend."" Instead, focus on how can you make others happy without wanting anything in return. The moment you exhibit that you're hanging with someone only to win them over, you'll find yourself on the short end of every friendship. You basically have to think in terms of, ""what can I bring to the table that will make this person even better/happier?"" and having that attitude will attract people to you. And, by extension, *maybe* a romantic partner. (I'm typing 'maybe' in italics because sometimes it's **okay** to be friends; some people are content being single their whole lives and that's fine too. I'm one of them).

If you feel like you're being too distracted by social media or Discord, it might be a good idea to segue your day such that you don't spend more than 1-2 hours interacting with people. Sometimes it's good to take time off of the web and focus on reading or playing a good single player game (~~like *Dark Souls*~~). I've been carefully planning my days for something like 4-5 years now thanks to a journal and while it doesn't always work, it's good to at least try. Monitoring how much time you spend on everything is key to improving your life, because time is something you can never have more of. I was constantly on edge that my days kept vanishing without me even realizing, and the older you get, the more this begins to claw away at you.

You can do it <:MonikaThumbsUp:929805006838825050>","",""

I should have been more specific with my situation, but I really didn't wanna break the character limit and I had a lot to say already lol: one person who I was dating for a little friendzoned me, and another person who I knew as an acquaintance kinda-friend  friendzoned me after I asked her out. What happened last week was someone rejecting me in a very rude and nasty way, and although I don't feel bitterness towards her, that definitely did cause me to feel extremely lonely and unworthy and feeling like people can't be interested in me. But yeah, thank you for your advice, and that's definitely something that still applies to my situation, I just feel like what I said might have been misunderstood, so I'm sorry about being that brief lol.

I'm not really a planning person tbh, I just do stuff spontaneously most of the time lol. I feel like my problem is more a lack of anything for me to do that feels fulfilling in any way, so I just try to distract myself. Maybe I should plan stuff more tho, thank you again for your advice!","",""

I had my first dog for 10 years, and she passed while I was away on vacation. That numb feeling is also extremely accurate to what I felt as well. The first couple of days were just non-stop tears, and then it felt like I didn't have anything left in my body at all. I felt numb and uncaring, even though - like you said - I knew I did care. It's all part of the process of grief, and like all processes in life, you'll work your way through it. Things will probably feel very hard and somewhat lonely for a time, but consider those hardships to be proof of how deeply you loved and cared for you dog. The bad times will pass, as they always do, and eventually things will settle once more.

You have my deepest condolences for your loss. It sounds to me like you loved your dog very dearly, and I want to reassure you that, despite the feelings of guilt you currently shoulder, you haven't done anything wrong. I know it's hard now, but I promise you things will get better eventually. Be patient with yourself as you grieve - there is no time limit on recovery.","",""

I am supposed to graduate this semester and be done with uni, but I feel insanely anxious constantly. I feel like anything and everything is about to go wrong or fall apart, looking for mistakes I have made here and there that will cost me. I recently realised I missed two separate big things that should not have flown under the radar, it made me more anxious about things and this will probably continue for a while. They haven't caused any damage yet but I decided to not fix one of them and even though it seemingly won't cause any problems I feel a horrible feeling it will bite me in the ass i will be too slow to take action. I re-check everything to make sure they are fine, and they are, but I am anxious anyway. I hate being this way. I hate losing hair from stress since I was 19. I love myself, but I fucking *hate* these part. Our economic problems and my physical and psychological health are not getting better either. I am bullshitting my way through physical problems because of a low-income upbringing leading to a lack of pushing things under the rug, If I was rich, I would get checked for everything yearly. I feel like my body might be falling apart? My psyche doesn't feel great either but I don't think I have a budget to see someone. I just wish I was a bit more normal. A bit healthier, a bit less anxious. I might have some undiagnosed bullshit, although I don't like self-diagnosing so I will not comment further, although I have been known to miss social cues and I already wrote about the anxiety stuff. I have been detaching from my hobbies lately too which scares me thinking it might be depression signs.

There was another guy that showed some interest in her but at the time I didn't mind it that much. Today I found out they got together. So I'm just now asking myself since when did they have something like that going etc. Can't stop overthinking.

I kinda want to just transform into a zombie and just have my head completely empty for once.

This is giving me so much anxiety for some reason having learnt that, it makes me panic everytime I think about that idk. It's 7a.m where I live rn and I've woke up like 3 hours ago with anger frustration anxiety and other negative feelings, shit sucks","",""
"190188039719485440","jelly386","2022-02-11T07:17:28.8760000+00:00","Hi Kael. Lemme first say that I'm so sorry you're struggling with this, and that I hope things get better for you soon. As I tell everyone in here, it's important to know that things *will* get better with time. Bad times - like all times - end eventually.

I've experienced something similar to you, I believe. I was also in a relationship where, very shortly after the breakup, my ex got together with another guy who had been showing interest in her. They hooked up 4 days after we broke up, to be precise, and it was the catalyst for me cutting contact with her entirely. Obviously some of that can't apply to your situation, but I want you to know that I'm coming from a similar place of grief.

I can also empathize with that post-breakup obsession and confusion about feelings of genuine love. These are both things that I dealt with during my breakup in 2020 and continue to deal with on a far lesser scale today. These questions are very likely going to weigh heavy on your mind for some time, which is perfectly normal. A fresh wound stings much more than a scab. Overthinking is bound to happen, but I encourage you to ground yourself when you notice it happening. That's not to say that you need to turn your brain off entirely, only that you should be mindful of the distinction between thinking and *over*thinking.

Here's my advice in regards to the issue of genuine love, though it may sound somewhat mean: it's not a question which will help you in any way. Spending time pondering the feelings of others that you can only interpret based in indirect interaction and memories is like trying to catch a fish with a hookless rod. You can cast the line all day long, but the chances you actually reel in a fish are slim-to-none. The important thing to consider at a time like this is what *you* know and what *you* feel. Focus on your own feelings - even your grief - and truly consider them thoroughly.","",""
"190188039719485440","jelly386","2022-02-11T07:29:14.3770000+00:00","As for the second issue of discovering her new relationship so soon after the end of this one: that's something I'm still struggling with myself.

The urge to check up on the person you cared for can be especially strong - they were an important aspect of your life, so not knowing what's going on can be maddening. The curiosity can tie your stomach into knots, but so can knowing the truth. When I learned that my ex was in a relationship so soon after our breakup, I was having full-blown panic attacks too. I wondered when they got together, how long this had been going on, why I hadn't seen earlier, why it was happening to me, and so many other questions of grief and paranoia. I checked her social medias even when I knew it would hurt me, because I felt that not knowing would make me more anxious than seeing something I couldn't stand. I'd advise you not check up on her, but I know that quitting cold-turkey isn't as easy as it sounds. I'll ask that you do something my therapist recommended to me: if you really feel the need to check up on her, make a scheduled time for it. Set an alarm in your phone for a specific time of day where you can check her social medias for a short period of time, and do not allow yourself to do so outside of that time.

In my case, I came to realize that when the scheduled time to check grew closer and closer, my anxiety would gradually rise. It got the point that even getting close to the alarm time made me more anxious than actually seeing anything to begin with, at which point I realized that the entire process of even checking her social medias was just harmful. 

I worry I might be projecting too much, so I'll stop for the time being. My point in all of this is that I feel I can empathize with your pain, and I desperately hope that you can get through this difficult situation and come out on the better side of it. Just know that what you're feeling is normal, and that your anger, grief, anxiety, fear, sorrow, and pain are all part of the process of recovery. Feel your emotions out rather than repressing them. You're in a tough spot, but you're not in any immediate danger. It's okay to crack a little. It's okay to be a little weak. Things will get better, and I sincerely hope that they get better soon.","",""

I know it's hard to be level-headed about events that are yet to come in several months from here on out, because they often require way too much forethought. Especially when you're barely holding together and the pressure only increases. 

I think it's very easy to be self-destructive on the worst days. I've had it happen many times over over the years. Although I'm no psychologist, I believe it has to do with our internal defensive mechanisms, trying to withdraw from a daunting situation. As in, if you admit you're a loser, you'll be a loser, but at least you'll be safe, right. Why tread on shaky ground when you can just find yourself a sweetly rotting bed to lie upon.

But thinking about it, it goes to show that you're being driven by a desire to achieve greatness. You **have to** struggle, you **have to** go the distance in order to shape your life the way you want it to be. And it's only a natural part of the journey. Just accept the limits of your current situation and work your way within those constraints; do not mourn the fact you aren't something greater than you really are. Expectations are almost never a good thing, since they come from a place of someone else wanting to control you, rather than you developing your goals through introspection.

I'm pleased to hear you continue with your driving lessons. Believe me, you will pat yourself on the back, several years from now, for sticking to it and developing that skill. Whether you find a job or not is entirely up to you but I'm sure you'll make the right decision. 

Cheerio! <a:JoeJAM:915332665404694660>

It's scary.
The way my mind can just flip and make me totally uncomfortable.

Woke up, felt empty, nothing to do. Then I pick up a phone and remember I've killed the last week not doing anything.
I don't know what to do.
I'm so lost. Nothing seems right.
I need to get my health together, but I'm so uncomfortable making appointments, I just leep postponing it. 
I need to get a psychologist, maybe a psychiatrist, but I'm unable to make that call either. Nobody at home knows. I can't open up to them. It feels impossible. Whenever I start saying something I end up lying. 
I also need to get a job and find purpose in life. 
Like I need to go to a uni, but idk whst to study. I'm as dumb as a brick, plus nothing interests me. 

People always say get a job, but getting a job made me even more miserable, since I was stuck there.
It felt like I was wasting my life away, and yet when I quit, I couldn't change that.
All this life confusion is amplified by my other problems like depression, flashbacks/uncomfortable memories of fathers death, states of absolute detachment, moments when I can't process my senses, anhedonia etc...
I'm so scared that I'm just broken, and that it will drag me down for the rest of my life.

first of all, getting a gf will not solve the underlying problem of stress-induced anxiety - if you do, your mind will latch to something else, like not making as much money as the next guy, or living in not the best place, all the way to the things you actually cant have any input on
this happens because anxiety is a cognitohazardous habit that seeks to rationalize itself in your mind, to provide a reason for why youre feeling the way you feel
the way you fight it is like any other habit, by being aware of it and trying to unlearn it
you need to actively indulge in hedonism, playing games makes you feel good? do that
if you catch yourself thinking anxious thoughts, you need to either force yourself to think of something else or go do anything that will distract you from thinking those thoughts
avoid situations that might flare up your self-punishing habit, the most dangerous time is when youre going to sleep, i have not found a solution for that part yet
i dont know if its possible to fully unlearn this habit when its instilled hard enough, since life is full of stress-inducing situations, but doing all of the above im way less of an anxious wreck than i was back in highschool","","‚òùÔ∏è (1)"

Something I learned over time is that, as uncomfortable and difficult and weird as it feels, sometimes the kindest thing to do, for yourself and others, is be very honest. So if I'm worrying that I'm bothering someone or taking up too much space in their lives, I ask them about it. I tell them that I really value their company/advice/help/friendship and that I want to make sure that I'm not bothering them/being annoying and yeah, sometimes in the past the question I had to ask was ""do you hate me."" 

Being so honest about our fears and insecurities feels terrible, because we're exposing the softest, most vulnerable parts of ourselves. Overwhelmingly though, the people I've been honest with like that have responded positively. Which isn't to say I've never been told that the other person could use some space from the thing bugging me. In the moment, it hurts, I won't lie. But bringing those things into the light alleviates the anxiety around the things we leave unsaid. And when you keep working at creating the space to talk about that stuff, it starts to lose its power over us, because you're eliminating the places where uncertainty and miscommunication can exist. 

<@348189691121762305> , I would really encourage you to consider being frank with your mom about your worry that you're annoying her.

I've known my partner for a few years, but we only started dating a few months ago. They are the same age as I am. Since then, they have opened up to me a lot about their rise in depression and anxiety. School is taking a huge toll on them and it's very challenging for them to find motivation. They are on a student loan and they are worried that if they fail a class, the school will drop them and they'll have to start paying their loans and give up on their career goals. Every day seems to be a struggle with them and although they are going to therapy sessions through their school programs, it is not long-term and they are afraid that they cannot afford long term therapy or medication. They struggle with suicidal thoughts and they tell me that it's been getting worse every day. Their mental illnesses have started to take a toll on me as well and I'm starting to feel helpless. They don't want to tell their therapist or anyone else about their suicidal thoughts because they are worried about being placed in an institution and they hear many stories about that making it worse for their patients rather than making it better. I feel like no matter what I say, it makes everything worse, or that I'm not doing enough to help. I try to talk to them and be there for them but they live 65 miles away and its difficult to see them often. I am having troubles coping with their problems. They tell me they are sad several times every single day and I don't know what I'm supposed to say or do and I feel like I can't open up to them about how it has made me feel because then they will not want to open up to me about their problems even though I want to try and share that burden and help.

You may love someone so much but if you are already trying your best to be supportive and help and they still need more and you cannot provide it, it is essential to look after yourself first and foremost as you cannot help others if you need help yourself. I would say this situation is akin to seeing someone drown, you cant just dive in after them because you can get pulled down and drown too. You clearly love them and are doing what you can, so I think maybe you should talk to them about what tangible problems they have, and what tangible solutions you can provide to them, you mentioned them being worried about their college, maybe you could discuss with them if their college provides monetary support for those in harsh economic situations, or if the college can work with them to give them more breathing room regarding a class. As long as you are actively trying to help its important that you don't burn yourself out trying to solve all of someone else's problems, because its impossible to do that. If they are worried they cannot afford therapy or medication, they might be able to consult with any kind of insurance provider and see what they can do to maybe help?

Its hard to enjoy anything when you keep comparing and thinking about others. I think maybe it could be helpful to talk or hang out with a close friend, and decompress with them. If you cannot hang out with your friend, maybe you could interact with someone close to you, or take a day and do something unorthodox, like go out to nature or go to a mall or just go somewhere new?

1. Unfortunately, their family doesn't have any kind of health insurance or anything like that so they are trying to find affordable therapy and the search is... well it's not totally helpless. There might be some options.
2. I like the idea about trying to at least solve tangible problems. Sometimes, I try to offer solutions, but it ends up frustrating them more, which I understand. Sometimes you just want to be heard rather than being told solutions. Its a difficult balance though. Sometimes I don't know what to say because I'm not sure what will make it worse so I don't say much, but then they say ""you aren't even trying to help, what's the point in talking."" and I get that perspective because I understand they are upset and they aren't really considering my feelings at that point. We talk about it though, and they apologize when they know they have hurt me and they genuinely try to do better. The ***trying*** part is really something that I appreciate about our relationship and it's one of the reasons why I think its more healthy than unhealthy.

I've looked up a few articles and a piece of advice that I'm trying to follow is to not stress or overthink so much about things that I don't have control over. And that mindset helps sometimes. It's not always applicable which makes it challenging but I'm trying. I appreciate your words.

I have been having problems with sleeping too little or too much because of my radical work schedule hours and because of some of the stress from the relationship, it really has been draining me a lot. I don't enjoy my hobbies as much, I don't have many friends to talk to anymore, and I generally just don't feel like doing much of anything that isn't just laying in bed.

Usually I tend to wake up fine, and then spiral into unbearable pain to the point I have to dedicate all my willpower to not fall apart. I genuinely don't know what would happen if I snapped. Back when I was in elementary school (bullied), I used to snap very nice often. I got very frustrated over time and when I couldn't deal with it anymore I threw a tantrum/ had short bursts of anger, usually in form of screaming or physical violence towards objects like pillows. Nowadays I tend to just bottle things up, be ot anger, sadness, depression... I always wear a mask, and I can't take it off. I want to trust people, but I can't take it off. 
It got to a point where my mother thinks I don't care about fathers death.
It's humiliating, and painful to say the least.

To be transparent, feelings aren't all the stuff I mask. I also hide my weird behaviors, that I know aren't normal. Stuff like weird movemets, thought patterns, I also feel lost all the time etc... 
I realize I should get tested for autism, I just can't... I'm unable to take off the mask and face reality. It drains me completely, and I can't go on like this","",""

I feel like music is the outlet I can use to get rid of negative emotions through expression of those emotions through the music. For you I do not know what that thing would be but I think if you could find something like that, it would be really helpful to ground your emotions. I also think that you should not bottle up every single emotion, it is okay to express some sadness, or express some anger, or express some emotion other then happiness or neutrality. Obviously you should not release all your emotions at once but having feelings other then what society expects is normal and not weird. to get onto that aspects of the mask you mention, weird behaviors are normal, super normal. I know in my experience I sometimes do odd things physically or mentally, but thats normal sometimes. Unless these weird movements or thought patterns are intrusive to your daily living I would not put much weight into them existing at all. If you think you should get tested for autism, why is it that you feel you cant? The mask you mention is what you want to show the world, it seems like to me that you are scared to be yourself to others, and although its easier said then done, I think you should feel more comfortable in your own body,  expressing your own thoughts, and feelings and stuff like that.","",""

I think that ultimately if they are good and worthwhile people to you, you opening up to them in some ways should not be harmful. If you feel like you cant talk about somethings with your support system, do you know why that might be? Do you fully trust your support system?

If you feel like all these things are true, then you might be someone who needs a therapist or another trained mental professional who can be a support system that wont be biased against you.

After all, modeling good self care practices and boundaries is part of being a role model!

You're still quite young and still maturing, so while your feelings of responsibility are valid, it may be worth remembering that folks as much older than you as you are to your friends are that much more developed. A flip doesn't get switched at 18 or 21 that makes you suddenly able to handle really difficult situations. Who/where would you look for help with issues like your friends'? It may be better to help them with their growth (skills/hobbies/plans) and instead of shouldering their burdens, facilitating a connection with them and the kind of supports that are best suited to help them.

Lastly point, and please don't take this as critique: it sounds like you formed these relationships and quickly fell into a supportive, helping position and them into dependence.

It's come to my attention that the rule prohibiting talk of suicide has been slipping a bit. The topic is coming up more and more lately. I know that many of you are having a difficult time right now, which is why you're here, and many of you are already speaking to mental health professionals with varying degrees of success. But I need to remind you that we are not professionals. We're just people who care about you and want to help and support however we can. Unfortunately that is very limiting for us. We cannot safely engage in conversation with you about suicide, or suicidal ideation, or anything like that without potentially making things worse for you or anyone else who may be reading these posts. It's unsafe and irresponsible for us to do anything more than diffuse the situation and point you to the pins here, where helpful information is offered, and to tell you to speak to a mental health professional about what you're going through and how you're feeling. I wish we could do more. I wish we were qualified to do more, but we aren't, and we want this to be a safe and supportive space, not one where we risk doing real damage. Occasionally these posts might slip through the cracks as it's hard to moderate this. Nobody wants you to think we're dismissive or that we don't care about you, because we do.

You're allowed to hit rock bottom sometimes. But don't unpack and live there. What do you need to do to get to your knees? To crawl? To stand up again? Can you acknowledge and appreciate what you've been through, not just this year, but your entire life, that you've survived until now? You've coped however you needed to cope, for better or worse, until now. Mask or not, it's gotten you here. And change is scary. Taking off the mask and having others really see you is probably terrifying. But you know what? You're stronger than you think you are having survived what you have and you can probably handle it. And I mean that. You're resilient. You only need to take baby steps and try and get some professional help. I was always terrified they'd tell me something was wrong, and I put it off, and you know what? Something was wrong and they told me so. And I didn't die. My world didn't end. I had to wrap my head around it, sure. But knowing what was happening was easier and the treatment made the diagnosis worth it. Don't be so afraid of not being able to be better. This, right now, doesn't have to be forever. But you can't treat what you don't understand. Don't deny yourself that information. So many people juggle multiple mental illnesses and disorders in life and they, with help, can thrive. So please, give yourself a break. It's scary and daunting and rock bottom feels hopeless--but you can still get better.","",""

Telling a friend or family member personal things is very vulnerable.  You're always welcome to talk to me if you want to, I hope you know that, and I know many of the people who frequent this channel feel the same way and their DMs are open. So if you ever want to let some of those things out, that might be a way to break the ice, and then you can chip away at it with people IRL when you're more comfortable. Just a thought. But I do hope you get the help you need soon, regardless of how you go about it. There isn't one right way. Mental health isn't one size fits all. You have to do what is best for you. But please be kind to yourself. Be the person you need right now, to yourself, as bizarre as that sounds. It helped me so much when I started doing that. It fails sometimes, but it gets easier with practice. The support you need, give it freely to yourself. You're trying and that's really important. <@!188224129122435072>","",""

In the past I've noticed for myself that I feel less motivated around this time of year generally and that it tends to come back each year for me. But last year I was able to work through it by working on a project with other people together who keep you awake in a way. If you talk about the subjects you want to learn with people it helps you remember them better as you are actively engaging in them. I've also noticed for myself that if I sit a lot it keeps my motivation at a low where as I take a walk and am a more active person in a day I tend to be more motivated and am able to read and listen better too. I'm of course not sure in what kind of situation you are, but I can imagine that if you are learning from home (due to covid) it could make the motivational dip worse as it lets you be active less. Where in between classes you'd have to go to the other class or talk with people, if you take class from home you likely won't have that and be very static. That's what I've noticed with myself at least. So my suggestion would be to see if you can talk with classmate friends about the subjects and see if that helps you understand them better.","","ü´Ç (2),üëç (1)"

And just the act of walking also helps me think better about things. That's something that helps me relax and rest mentally. Being lazy isn't exactly the same as resting or relaxing. You can be lazy and at the same time get a lot of mental impulses through games or videos. 
I don't think you'll stay lazy or that you are lazy, as interacting with the people here to talk about your problems is already a step to trying to resolve or at least process them.  You might not like the things you have to do for school, but my guess would be that there are other things that you are interested in and that you would be interested in doing and would give you that motivation. 
The lockdown period has been heavy for a lot of people, you certainly aren't the only one who has these struggles. I've been struggling with it quite a bit too and trying to find ways to not have as much of a struggle. It's a process of learning and adapting. Becoming more organized could help with that too as you said. You could start with small things, like making a list of things you have to learn and trying to understand it in small bits instead of everything at once. being organized can differ from person to person so it's something that can take a bit to know how it works best for you.","",""

Although your line pertaining to how you don‚Äôt view people you hang out with as ‚Äòactual human beings‚Äô is a little creepy, I think I can see where are you coming from. (Obviously you didn‚Äôt say that out of malice). Personally, I subscribe to the idea that if you are privy to your own worth, and you have your priorities straight, you will attract the right kinds of people, without needing to actively seek them out. In my day, I had to let go of many acquaintances, since I only want to surround myself with people I genuinely care for. It‚Äôs a lot like playing a survival game and hogging healing items, and then beating the game without ever resorting to them; you don‚Äôt need hundreds of people in your life to be happy.

I find that on the topic of managing one‚Äôs time, people have a very binary idea of what it truly means to be productive. Either you sit down and study, or you do something for leisure and thus waste your time. In reality, sometimes the time you spend doing something otherwise meaningless will contribute to your feeling of fatigue, which may (or may not) prompt you to seek change within yourself. Of course this is down to an individual, but my point is sometimes you have to fail before you can take your first step on the path to greatness. In order words, try not to dwell on how much time you‚Äôve wasted.","",""

I know the pandemic is far from pleasant and wearing a mask is frustrating, but think of it as an event you will come back to in the future. Eventually COVID will be just a darker page in history and a reminder for you to treasure not just your health, but your ability to enjoy something as simple as a stroll through the mall, without worrying about any such ubiquitous disease. In other words, do not blame the luck of the draw on your own bad play.

Also, grades are nonsensical. Same with those exams meant to evaluate a person‚Äôs linguistic savvy. Just think about how illogical it is: language is comprised of thousands of not just words, but also idioms, expressions and pop culture references. And even if you are familiar with the principles themselves, applying said principles in a meaningful manner takes a substantial level of ingenuity. To think that years, if not decades, required to properly accustom yourself to a language can be handily summarized in a handful of multiple choice questions is borderline insulting to your intelligence. (Shoutout to <@!102508803244699648> , they pointed this out really aptly: **If you talk about the subjects you want to learn with people it helps you remember them better as you are actively engaging in them.**)","",""
"456226577798135808","Deleted User","2022-03-13T16:58:52.2120000+00:00","Some more practical advice: consider writing a journal. Get yourself a plain ruled notepad, a pen and inscribe your exploits on a daily basis. It may seem weird at first, but you‚Äôll quickly notice having a journal helps you think clearly and alleviate that sense of ‚Äúwhat did I accomplish this entire month?‚Äù I know first hand it‚Äôs a bad feeling to have.

Another tip: drink water. Lots and lots of water. Do not consume soda or energy drinks. Your diet contributes to your ability to make judgement calls a lot more than you may give it credit. (I‚Äôm not saying you aren‚Äôt aware of it, but it‚Äôs worth repeating nonetheless).

For inspiration, I recommend good movies. There are good long-running series out there as well but I personally don‚Äôt watch any, so I can only speak for theatrical films. If you would like a list of movie recommendations, please don‚Äôt hesitate to DM me. I also stream many of my favorite films on my Discord server, every Friday.

If you are a gamer, then I strongly discourage playing most online-only titles. Many of them will take up far too much of your spare time and they aren‚Äôt something you should use to fill your life with. There is nothing more sad than people who are both passionless and addicted to MMO‚Äôs and MOBA‚Äôs. 

If you haven‚Äôt already, play DARK SOULS. Any of them. Many people have testified the Soulsborne games have genuinely helped them cope with depression and for a good reason; they are about overcoming adversity. I also strongly recommend Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization games, as they improve your ability to plan ahead and think long-term.

Though it's not helping that i cant be myself when i talk to people always having to put up a face that's just not interesting, not unique. But i think i'll get through that with time soon enough..anxiety has been bringing me down since the pandemic mostly because i just cant talk to people normally through chat messages it just isnt the same. The same goes for meeting people online just cant get enough courage to speak or say hello. And also about wasting time, you're definitely right. I just feel like i'm wasting time when i dont study because most people around me just seem to get good grades without even breaking a sweat. I cant even think about dropping my grades because if i do my family will abondon me without giving me a second chance. The education system here sucks, you wont believe how much time i spent studying just to get into an university, wasted years just for a single exam that decides my life for me. I think that's what really drained me out of literally everything; my empathy for others is nonexistent because i just cant bring myself to care enough for them while i'm struggling, i cant even feel sad without thinking ""if i cry i'll waste my time"" ...i just hate it.  **No matter how much i study i just cant get anything into my head it's just too messy** but besides that as you said, i guess watching interesting movies or playing games could make me feel better, maybe as a distraction, or i could actually get back into art and improve on that a little, idk if thats productive but it's better than sitting around..","","ü´Ç (1)"

This is true even on Discord; I have been to dozens of servers, with either a handful of active members, or several hundred, and the dynamics remain the same. I‚Äôm at a point where I can see a dull conversation coming from a mile away, precisely because I have so little spare time.

I know when you‚Äôre in college, you sort of have to befriend people because exams are like a raid boss that your entire Facebook group is preparing for. It‚Äôs one of the biggest reasons why I left the university; I often felt like I was the only person really doing anything. And it didn‚Äôt help that the apathy expressed by the teachers echoed all over us, with our supervisor taking the cake for being the most unlikable wretch on the campus. Obviously this will vary from person to person (and from faculty to faculty) but I can claim with utmost certainty I‚Äôve never felt more unwanted than I did in my university days.

Anyway, I do hope my pep talk did not come off as overtly cold-hearted, because I ultimately do feel for you. A lot of what you‚Äôve said took me back to my early 20‚Äôs when my idea for what I wanted to do in life was far less substantiated. And I know it sucks, believe me. It sucks feeling like you have no agency over what‚Äôs going to happen, it sucks realizing that your parents guide and nurture you, only in so far as to have you fulfill the goals they‚Äôve set for you. It‚Äôs a tale as old as time; that we project our ambitions onto those we hold power over.","","ü´Ç (2),üíô (1)"

The severity of every bad situation is subject to your point of view. Obviously I don't know you but from the way you formulate your thoughts, I get the impression you've managed to get through worse situations before. It's something more external that frustrates you; the exam is just a cherry on top of a bowl of ice-cream that was never frozen to begin with.

But it *is* the exam you need to focus on, and to this end, I'd recommend a break. Go outside, don't listen to music, don't take your phone with you. Try to quiet down and listen to your own heartbeat. You have more strength than you realize.","","ü´Ç (2)"

I was just like any other kid, maybe a bit too curious and nosy but made friends enjoyed life. I made two friends in second grade, one guy one girl. We stayed friends for a long time, the girl kinda drifted away but still friends. However in middle school I caught feelings for her, so I extended a hand and asked her out. She said no but would like to reconnect. The next two years I would get dates, hangouts, etc, but about half would fall through. She would go cold for days then spam me with affection. This was breadcrumbing, emotional abuse, and she then stopped one day, never to talk to me again. 
The guy friend, he moved to the other side of town and our friendship moved more online. We had been friends for eight years, but he started blowing up at me randomly. I would hyper react with care and love but he would block, come back in a week, spam me with sorries and affection then would blow up the next week. This was textbook emotional abuse. He eventually left me bevause I was so torn up about his health and I tried helping him so much he got so mad me punched me and left. 

I get into college. I meet this lady at a fancy scholarship retreat thing, and she seemed like a kindred spirit. I talk with her and we instantly hit it off. Time goes on of very frequent interaction and I start getting feelings. I ask her out, she says no but to still be friends, maybe date later. That is what started the end, by no fault of my own. From that day forward she slowly started pulling away from me. Lying, withholding affection, not telling me important things, no providing support when needed, guilt tripping, etc. it was very subtle, but I noticed it and communicated it. For 2.5 years I communicated my concerns, provided outlets for us to 1/2","",""

They made the choice to destroy the relationship.
Every relationship, that does not end in a mutual acknowledgement of unmatching expectations and a respectful parting of ways after trying solutions to no avail, has someone deliberately avoiding that choice, and destroying the relationship.
Technically, most relationships, even with horrible behaviors, can persist with sufficient care, effort, and patience between BOTH parties. But that‚Äôs the things. Both. Parties.

I also wanted closure, even though I knew he wouldn't apologize, I was hoping for at least an acknowledgement of what had happened. I realized after talking with one of my other friends that this wouldn't work out, it would be used to start an argument, and it would just go badly. Every time I had tried to be honest/sincere with this guy after a certain point, it hadn't gone well at all. I ended up blocking him and leaving every server I was on with him, and not talking to him irl. Since then, I've felt so so much better about the situation and I'm feeling like my social situation is definitely getting a lot better. I had delayed cutting him off for at least 3 months, and it just got worse and worse, to the point where pretty much every single interaction with him was angry and ruined my day. Point being, sometimes you have to just cut people off. Some people will just use anything as an excuse to be assholes, and although I don't remember every detail of your situation, I do think that seems to be the case for your friend. This is 100% your decision and your situation, and it is important that you are the one to make your decision, but in my experience, sometimes closure just isn't worth trying for.

I get so full of rage, not at other people or characters but at myself for being a moron unable to keep up with my peers in the game. 

Playing this in private, I'm punching myself in the legs and head, scratching myself, I've torn apart one of my shirts, I just am the utter epitome of a self destructive manchild. 

I keep coming back to the game even though I spend most of my sessions saying to myself ""I'm a moron, I should be shot, I'm too dumb to live, etc."" I'm even so pathetic as to apologize to the other players that I'm such garbage. 

At this point I've tried so many times to uninstall it, but I just end up reinstalling the game in the next few days. Each time I think I'm quitting for my mental health (which I am), but then I end up thinking it's no big deal, I just need to get better, etc. I'm just a complete incompetent adrenaline filled self-hatred monster when I play.

I just HATE who I am, because at this point I don't feel like I'll ever get out of this self destructive loop. I'm ""good"" enough at the game that it's basically my only source of pride and validation, so I can't actually stay away from it.

I haven't been where you are and our situations are not the same, but certain things you've said I can relate to. Part of me feels like because of this, I am not in a position to comment. But the other part of me feels like you are being incredibly hard on yourself and it's been difficult for me to sit quietly.

I know you said you've struggled with this for a long time and had therapy when you were younger. I also know you've said that change is hard (it is) and you struggle with consistency. I'm wondering if you have any way to be accountable to yourself or have anyone in your life who could keep you accountable. It's quite common from what I understand in mental health situations for people to stop doing what helps them, therapy or other habits, as soon as they are doing better. Same as you'd stop your medication once you feel better. Mental health is not a straight line and there are many ups and downs and roundabouts. It's also something I've gone though thinking ""I can't be helped, I'm too far gone"" and it turned out to not be true. You sound like you have a lot of negative self talk keeping you in your hole and you don't counter it or try to revise it, you simply believe it, and there's not necessarily truth to any of it. Just because you think it doesn't make it true.

I have bipolar disorder and some weeks (especially off the medication) are a wash. I then spend time ""catching up."" I have four small children who need attention obviously. I don't have it all figured out. I do not feel my age. I sometimes wonder at my responsibilities and how I've gotten here. I often feel overwhelmed and that I can't handle things. I put things off that I don't want to deal with. I don't consider myself to be a woman-child.

Yes, yours is more extreme than many, but you're struggling with mental health issues and I think it's more common than you think for people to write this off as laziness and being childish, to put themselves down, and tell themselves they are just shit, all the while keeping themselves locked in vicious cycles where their behaviour causes them the justification needed to believe it further. With help you can break this cycle and once you see even the smallest change, it is proof that change IS possible, and you can take another baby step, then another, then another. But you need to find a way first to be accountable and actually stand up. You're in a hole, yes, that doesn't mean you have to live there. There are people with several mental illnesses, with addictions, with trauma who manage to find their way. Don't discount that for yourself. With the right treatment, a psychiatrist maybe in addition to a therapist, and some support you might learn how to be your own support going forward. These things take time though and change is incredibly difficult, especially when you feel you're too far gone to even start.","",""

I would be more optimistic if I haven't had a lifetime of false starts, revelations about the things that have held me back and how I could change for the better, only to have those fixes fade away the moment I have to take consistent action for behavioral change instead of having a single heroic moment to fix things for good.

In terms of accountability, I have people like my mom I can reach out to, but I really don't want to put that kind of burden on her. If I can do my best to project strength and act like I have my shit together to ease her worry about me taking care of myself, I feel obligated to do so. She's got enough to deal with without learning that I'm doing something as humiliating as punching myself again as a coping mechanism for my anger.

I have an exercise bike in my living room. Nothing fancy. But it is working well for me, mentally and physically. Could you have your mother or friend check-in with something like that, which is less humiliating and worrisome and see if it bleeds over to any other part of your life?

My other thought was instead of therapy, could you find someone like a life coach? I don't know a lot about them but my understanding is they're like a personal trainer for your goals. Just a thought that they might be able to keep you on track.

I'm embarrassed to say this but I want to be honest: many of my goals I have not reached in about 15 years, since my mental health took a nosedive. I've been implementing (recently, so it might still fail), a 20 minute approach around the kids: 20 minutes on the bike, then do something else. 20 minutes of cleaning (set a timer if you need to), then do something else. Even 20 minutes of something fun. The idea is that 20 minutes over the course of a week is enough for most things and you can repeat multiple times a day if need be. I'm trying this now and some days it's helped, other days (like today) with the kids are just a shitshow. The idea is to make it so easy that I can be like ""it's only 20 minutes, like a handful of songs you'd listen to"" and also once you start you're more likely to continue once the alarm goes off.

It's just, could you pick like one thing to focus on? Make it as easy as possible: no big lifestyle changes or scary fitness routines or oppressive diets. And if you need to call in supports for a run with friends, do it.","",""

I fully agree that focusing on small incremental changes seems like the best path towards longterm behavioral change, I just wish those changes would actually stick for once in my case.

What doesn't tend to help is hating yourself for having self-hating thoughts, because that just forms a vicious cycle.
This is why the ""gently"" part is important. 
Sorta just, discard the thought if you can do that. Or reply to it with ""it's alright"".
 Really, this is just mindfulness/meditation but without picking out a specific moment for it. I find myself falling back on having these negative thoughts about myself sometimes, but it tends to go away after a while.

I've been a freelance illustrator since 2018 (dabbled in drawing since early childhood). From experience, I can say that all and any sources of inspiration are worthwhile to your own development as an artist. To say that personal trauma does not lend itself to creative outlets would be a fallacy, because examples to the contrary are dime a dozen. Examples like these are indie games like *Dysphoria*, *That Dragon, Cancer*, *GRIS* or even *EarthBound*. These are often lauded as good or great works of art, despite their morbid, depressive themes.

My point is, the events that take place in your life and the wisdom you'll have gained from them are wholly disparate matters. Some people have greatly uplifting experiences that end up harming them *and* their creativity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). 

On the other hand, something as terrible as the loss of a loved one could be a moment to reflect on the joyous time one has had with them, and to learn to let go of them. I know I had an epiphany like this. I watched my grandfather die, every day, for several months. When he was stranded alone on his deathbed, morbidly obese, writhe with Parkinson's disease, in the company of an oblivious wife who kept pouring medicine into him, daily, despite never caring for his diet and physical activity prior to this. I was the only one to notice that he was passing away when I visited him, every Friday, to read him a book. I miss him a lot, but I know his time has come and gone and the best I can do is to not forget him in the years to come.

I know losing your mother is a whole deeper layer of tragedy than watching a grandfather die slowly. As much as I feel for you, I know I haven't experienced a loss as substantial as you have. To this end, I know my advice might be ultimately misguided, but I hope I could help you nevertheless. Good luck~","",""

I'm just exhausted, but I feel like I can't do anything about it because it's my fault.

She means well when she keeps asking me about it, because she knows I procrastinate. I want to tell her that she doesn't need to keep asking me about it over and over again, because it always gets done eventually, but I can't. Sure, 9/10 it *does* get done, and I've been doing good about that this semester, but that 1/10 still exists. I've lied about assignments for extensive periods of time before. I lied about an assignment I needed to get done for an entire summer, and my financial aid hinged on it.

I told he she should stop drinking, and she became hostile. A lot of stuff has been said, I've called her a bitch, she accused me of being selfish, arrogant, foul mouthed etc., After which I blew up and started yelling, and blew out my voice. She never tried to argue anything, I'm nothing to her, my words can't reach her, she's so defensive, she can't process any advice, or opinion.

Getting a professional in current age is nigh impossible (covid, war, lack of therapists/psychiatrists), but that doesn't mean I shouldn't have tried more. Truth be told, I've been procrastinating on all my long term duties. I've killed 2 months of my time by doing fuck all.

Nothing of this is new for me. I've been struggling with this ""executive disfunction"" (not diagnosed, I'm just assuming) for as long as I remember.
The real problem is that I finally got around to looking up schools, and I've realized almost all application deadlines have passed. The few that remain are due in 2 days. I'm fucked
It's possible to send in applications, but I won't be able to chose a program really, and I doubt I'll stay in said universities (they're math focused institution, and I suck at math). 
To top all this up, I still have no clue what to study, I've been beating myself over this question for past 8 years, I just don't know. It feels like I'm too dumb to do anything at times. I've already forgotten 90% of what I've learned in high school and my first uni","",""

||It's been a pretty shit week JADS, I had a call last week about a very close family friend's dad taking their life. He was a like a second dad to me so it hit pretty hard. I had to drop everything and fly to the other side of the country for the funeral, it was very emotional but the service was beautiful as he had touched a lot of lives. It was nice to see the family again as their kids are pretty much my adopted brother and sisters. Being with them definitely made it easier to deal with things. I was running on pretty much no sleep and was having trouble eating but surviving none the less. However just as I got home from the funeral the next morning I got another phone call from my mother, the night of the funeral one of his daughters also took their life. This one really toppled me over, I only got two hours sleep that night and had just finished unpacking. You hear about being in shock but I'd never had the experience until then, I somehow managed to get myself back to the airport and fly back. I can't remember a thing after that phone call, I answered and had the conversation and then it felt like I just woke up as the plane touched down. I don't even remember going to the airport or booking the ticket. The following days have just been hell on earth, I'm wandering around like a zombie most of the time. We had a nice dinner with the family again, lots of tears, a few laughs and reminiscing. It's been hard for everyone, we're all just so distraught and angry, after all the pain and suffering her fathers choice caused for us all it's just so confusing. It all just comes in waves, the tears, the confusion, the anger, it's all just so exhausting. It's been a very bad week, I can barely eat without throwing up and I'm just so so tired <:cerealexperiments:551183313725816843> ||","","ghosthug (11)"

I just hope you understand that everything you are feeling right now is perfectly natural, take your time to build yourself back up again and come to terms with this. Have you reached out to your family about this? If not I'd like to encourage you to do so, as I'm sure they are all dealing with this same distress that you are. This can help both you and them understand that your not alone in this. I know its not easy to, but I truly hope that you do. Continue to eat as normally as you can and I hope that your eating problem can fix itself. If this persist you may develop a eating disorder, so please seek the help you need. I hope this has helped you at least somewhat. There is nothing wrong with that way you feel right now and understanding that is progress. Things wont look up right away, but I hope you can keep pushing on man.","",""

And if they are disappointed, that says more about them than it does about you. Lies, to yourself especially, but also to the outside world go hand in hand with mental health. You are not a piece of shit for not admitting sooner that you are not okay. It's more important and beneficial now to start being more honest, if not with them, than with yourself--about what is wrong and what you need right now. Therapy might take some time with all the wait lists and backlog, sure. But that time will pass anyway. You can pass it on a waitlist knowing in x amount of months you'll be talking to someone professionally, or you can continue to beat your head against this and not have taken that step: take the step. It's hard but it's worth it to know at least that you are doing everything you could to get better, instead of just getting up every day and living with it, knowing you haven't. I know you don't want to be a burden, but you can't live for other people and neglect yourself this way. There comes a point where you say: a lot happened when my father was sick, a lot happened after he died, it's been a revolving door of grief and stress and bullshit, I don't want to add to that--and if you don't, does it all just go away? Do you hide it forever? Or does the glass pretense start to crack and everyone learns the truth anyway and you suffer more? Or does it get so bad it can no longer be hidden and you need more immediate support? Do you see what I mean? Mental health does not discriminate because it will be a burden or it's not the ""right"" time for it. It's like any illness, it doesn't care.","","ghosthug (1)"

There is only more pain by hiding it away. It‚Äôs painful to admit it, but admitting my depression and anxiety saved me from a long term relationship with a narcissist, the ptsd solidified leaving.

It‚Äôs especially hard because I‚Äôve been abused the last seven years of my life, primarily by gaslighting. People in other discords, close friends, and one advisor tried playing that shit on me.

it made me rage somewhat, then I was deeply perplexed, why was someone so presumptious and mean with me just like that? what have i done?

worst part is we all know where she would have come from, having had to most likely tolerate countless other gym-bros before (even though I never saw that particular person draw attention to herself before me)

it's kinda bad, but oh well. I can kinda react impatiently with what I consider to be ""absurd"", but it feels like many people out there are ready to be hurt and take it out on some unsuspecting dumbass like me.

and honestly, i suspect that girls today struggle with dating just as much, there's many girls not getting the attention they would want, girls that feel unfulfilled with their options and kinda just... don't really date, girls that obsess over one guy expecting him to ""get serious"", etc...
perhaps a good start is to see it and empathize with it, and maybe even recognize the male counterpart of that behavior

I assume this is about the Tinder statement you did a while back. People were not upset about you being lonely, but that you specifically said you were angry at women for not being lonely. I think it's important for you to realise the difference here, because you can feel lonely and angry at the world for being that, but it is directing it towards women that drives people towards incel behaviour and hatred. A lot of valid points were raised against that comment, and I honestly can't help but to be a little insulted to the people who actually showed concern to you that you brush it off as ignorance, arrogance and ill will. There is no problems in using this channel to vent, or wanting to express loneliness, but the exact comment was ""Women can get laid on Tinder, that makes me angry"" and I do believe people were right in expressing concern in that wording. I don't think you meant any actual harm and that the intent behind your words weren't meant to convey an aggressive and hateful meaning, but that you may have worded it poorly.

All that said, I do genuinely wish things get better for you, and as stated above, I do agree that loneliness is a growing problem that isn't being properly addressed. Loneliness is extremely hard to deal with, especially if you have a lot of social anxieties. Don't take some of the feedback you get here as insults, because I don't think anyone wants to hurt you and that they genuinely mean well.","","üëç (8)"

All the blame was of the situation was put on me and it made me feel like I was treated as a monster.

So I had this roommate whom I guess I didn't really like. In my mind he was just very lazy and incompetent. So one day I was hosting this party and earlier that week I had asked my roommates to do their chores before that day, and they had agreed on that. But after a long day of work, mere hours before the party, I come home to find they hadn't done anything yet. I'm annoyed, I tell my roommates to do their chores please. This one roommate is gonna vacuum clean the living room, which you can do in a minute or two, but I want him to pay some extra attention to a few things. Honestly this dude ""cleaned"" the floor by just pouring a layer of water on it -_-. So as he's ready to plug in the electrical cord I'm like 'hey can you put down the electrical cord and listen to me'. Details get fuzzy here but I'm like 'put down the electrical cord and listen to me!', I must have said that like 20-40 times, saying it more angrily each time as he just kept holding it. Eventually he tries to put the electrical cord into the wall socket and I, agitated as I am, snap it out of his hand. And then storm after him as he flees to his room cause I'm like ""don't run away from your f-ing chore"".

Anyway I did a lot of things wrongly. I through use of anger tried to coerce my roommate to listen to me. I didn't back out of a situation I should have and while I felt in control of my anger I was probably very scary to look at. And in the heat of the moment I crossed some personal boundaries I should have been more aware of and know not to cross.","",""

And also, if you do the one thing that someone who's clearly agitated has been asking you dozens of times not to do, how can you still think you're completely innocent in all of it.  I'm not someone to hold grudges but this is like the one person whom if I ever met I would give the ""look of death"", cause I just hold so much bad blood towards XD.","",""

and taking from the way you asked them to do their chores before your party, that didn't sound like you were including them, and also sounds like you were embarassed from your roommates.
So overall I'm imagining a bad vibe.

With that assumption, I can't really blame them for not really caring about your party :/

And, I've also been in your position, being the angry flatmate going crazy over ""why can't they just wash their (fucking!) dishes!!"", but I realise I was kinda uncompromising, and also kinda unfriendly. They were also asshole and immature, but I could have acted better nonetheless.

I am having immense trouble with food lately, as in I'm addicted to eating either sweet or salty crap food more or less thrice a week, and it's driving me crazy.
I've put on some weight ever since my father died a few years ago, and now I'm trying to lose it, and every time I make progress I throw it all away and start from scratch because in a moment of lost clarity I just order huge amounts of whatever I feel like binging. Worst part is that it's not even good food, it never satisfies me and I hardly enjoy it!

And I feel like my entire being is refusing to take my dietetician seriously, where it feels like their guidelines are way too optimistic. I hear healthy breakfast and my nasty little part of myself says ""bullshit"".

It was simple, calory loss. However at the time I realise I had a structure to work with, I lived with my mother, she would occasionaly cook and overall I had a stable framework of food without me having to worry about it, back then it was as simple as simply eating less of what I had, and the fast food in Greece where I grew up was souvlaki or nothing. So I simply ordered souvlaki without fries and it was still more or less healthy.

Today I am trying to replicate that success, so I cut food but then I get hungry and get desperate. I can't quite describe it, but I feel like my food framework has completely collapsed ever since I moved out of my childhood home. I feel like it just got delayed repercussions because even though I had no framework, I was also broke af, so I couldn't indulge in shit food whenever I got the urge. Today, somehow I can afford crappy indulgences and got no framework (as in breakfast, lunch etc...), so in my occasional hungry desperation I overcompensate and order shitty and unhealthy food that I barely enjoy out of some misplaced survival instict.

I don't even know tbh, it drives me crazy, I tried so many things, but I keep reverting to that same desperate headspace...

I don't really have any illusions with weight loss, I've succeeded before, but I know that on average my weight hasn't even been reduced throughout the whole year! I'm trying to go from 95kg to 80kg, but every time I hit 92kg I break down and climb back up.
So no, I don't think it's sustainable, I'd rather figure out my mental unbalance and tackle it head on :/","",""

Thankfully all my previously abusive friends have apologized, and stopped doing it since.

I'm sorry that you're dealing with depression, that sucks. I hope you are getting the best help you can for that, and I hope that it is getting better. Doom-scrolling is a bad idea, but its also a really common thing people do, you cant beat yourself up about it. Its scientifically proven that bad news spreads faster then good news, and that the human brain is hardwired to find bad news that saddens you or angers you more often then good news, so for this reason it is immensely popular for companies and sites and places to post negativity into the world. What they don't tell you though is that there are tons of people working towards positivity, but that isn't shined on, because its not as appealing to post as something negative. I know that maybe that sounds na√Øve but I honestly believe it to be true. A lot of very good, smart, and powerful people are doing their best to make the world better and I hope that you can come to recognize it too. I get how the world feels hopeless, but you cannot let a feeling of hopelessness overpower you because becoming hopeless and giving up is what bad people want you to do. People who want you to feel these negative emotions want you to feel them so you end up not caring like some other people and not standing up for what you think is right. Regardless, I hope you feel better and I hope everything works out. I hope you can try your best to not think too much about it either.","",""

The last couple months have (probably) been the worst couple months of my life. Stress, physical pains, and depression have never been higher, and it's strained my relationships heavily - so much so that I verbally attacked one of my group mates in a university project... for little to no reason other than impatience and not really liking the guy. As of present, I have apologised to him (and the group as a whole). My relationship with my family and girlfriend has also suffered as a result or rage-fuelled out-bursts and bouts of depression where I stop caring about everything.

I'm a student who studies game programming. Prior to this I was an art student for 5 years. I'm 22 and I've developed chronic lower backpain (despite being a regular gym goer). 

I struggle to control my temper, so much so that (today) I flipped out at my girlfriend because I misread a message she sent. I feel like control over my life and my mind is fleeting at the moment. I feel trapped, living out the same days over and over. Wake up -> eat breakfast -> go gym -> program for 3-4 hours -> spend evening with gf (online) -> sleep. I spend most my time in my room and feel like I have no life. I have no (close) friends I can hang out with, and no university colleagues I can truly call friends.

I worry and doubt myself so often, despite getting top grades (in every single class to-date). University causes a large large amount of stress for me, and when I start getting angry, I panic, think I'm a failure, and struggle to stop what I'm doing. I push further and get more and more angry from the anxiety. 

As a kid I always thought I was special (pretty cringe I know). But growing up has made me realise that just being above average is very hard. I feel weak.","",""

Regarding physical pain: I can totally empathize there. The first thing I would absolutely recommend is changing your mattress. I had lower back pain all throughout college thats now disappeared after getting a quality mattress. So if you can do that, start there. The second thing I would reccommend highly is stretching every day. You don't have to go crazy with this in particular, but look up some basic yoga strectches like upward/downward facing dog. They're simple enough and may help with that pain. But definitely look into a better mattress if you can. Ideally, one of the newer ones that kinda curve with your existing figure.","",""

1) If you can't get a therapist, at the very least try talking to your doctor about getting on medication. You may have undiagnosed depressive/anxiety issues or minor/major BPD. This is nothing to be ashamed of. Medication will help you immensly, and at the very least, even you out.
2) Start journaling. Play therapist against yourself, and be a kind, listening voice as you do this. It may be harder than it sounds. Especially if you're not used to being a friend/kind to yourself. But in general, therapy will only ever really teach you that you have to be a friend to yourself. You also have to be honest with yourself while going through this... Here's how I do this. In a physical notebook with a pen, begin like this:
""T (therapist): So, what's going on?
Me: Shits fucked man. I have X, Y, Z assignments due on Friday, I feel like I could punch any wall I see, and I'm not being a good teammate for C class.
T: that's totally understandable. You have a lot of stressors in your life currently, and you don't have too many effective outlets for dealing with it. But look at your past work: you've managed to get through worse, so don't doubt yourself too much. School is nothing else if a gauntlet that you must get through. It sounds like your anger is getting the better of you to some extent. When this happens, why not try doing A, B, C (Going outside for a breather, listening to your favorite song, grabbing a coffee)? Try to get yourself out of your head, in essence.""

Doing stuff like this helps me when I feel like I'm down and out.","",""

My online persona is generally very peppy and easygoing, and while most days I find that easy to maintain, there are some days where my mental health issues just drain me of that ""positive energy.""

I've found that in times like these, it's surprising how accommodating people can be if you simply state that you're just not feeling 100% at the moment. Even just a simple ""I'm not doing too hot right now"" is often understood and accepted. It makes sense logically, of course: everyone knows that the person on the other side of the screen is a fully realized human being with their own emotions, moods, and struggles. However, as is often the case in mental health troubles, this reality can be somewhat difficult to realize and remember.

Allow me to state this plainly: it's perfectly acceptable - healthy, even - for you to feel sad, awful, or any variation of negative emotion. Emotion is a spectrum with highs *and* lows, and experiencing both is simply what it is to be human. It's okay for you to feel sad, even if sometimes it feels like it isn't. How you feel is nothing to be ashamed of.

It's okay if you can't manage bubbly and goofy right now, and you won't be letting anyone down by not being an unyielding pillar of positivity 100% of the time. Everyone needs a break now and then, so feel free to take it easy, okay?","",""

I think a while back I'd already spoken with someone here about this, though it's good to review even your own conclusions. It's fun learning from your past self. 

Parents love to project things onto their children. My dad is a lot like this: he constantly tells me how much he'd love for me to work with him, at his business. Parental expectations are part of a much larger problem we're often eager to gloss over, but here it is: we all want our relatives and friends to follow our agenda. If your worldview collides with that of your parents (which it likely is), you're bound to be at odds with them. It is something you just have to accept as part of life; you **have to** prove that your perspective is just as valid as theirs. Or at least do not allow theirs to eclipse yours. Unless you are twice my age, we are more or less part of one generation and our parents haven't grown up with prolific Internet access. They often try to apply outdated ideas to our lives, thinking they'll work just fine again. 

Personally, I do my best not to tell my parents *too* much. Financially I'm independent but I know I need to stay on their good side, *even* if I have to accept their backwards ideas sometimes. The degree to which you'll do that depends entirely on you, of course. But I hope you can see where I'm coming from.","",""

A year in a relationship is amazing. If not, if you feel it's beyond that... sometimes what is best for us hurts. It would be easier to stay and put up with it and deteriorate if it's not healthy for you. That's much easier than the heartbreak of walking away.

There's a 99% chance that all elected officials are humans and actually not aliens or something. Then, you place trust and faith based off what's most likely, that all elected officials are humans, while not entirely disregarding alternative theories but running them through some logic tests and trying to figure out the likelihood of an alternative theory. Is there a small group of people running the world and everything we think we know is completely false? Maybe. Is that the case? Most likely not, as there's tests both scientific and hypothetical that raise the likelihood that the world is fairly close to how it seems. Not perfectly 1:1, and like I said anything is possible, but it's important to assign highest likelihood to what has the strongest rational explanation first and go backwards from there and you'll realize most conspiracy theories are usually closer to the completely unlikely side of that spectrum. You could be experiencing really strong and confusing emotions based off of the lower probability, much scarier possibilities, and there's nothing wrong with having that feeling.","",""

My semester just ended and I did well on my finals and am expecting good grades in all of courses, so that's good. I made a couple new friends and managed to get a new roommate secured for the rest of my time at college, so that's good. I'm on my way home to finally relax with nothing on my schedule except hanging out with my best friend tomorrow, so that's good. The thing that's bothering me is... well, weird.

So my previous roommate was a close friend of mine. Out families are friends and we've been friends since Kindergarten. We've been roommates every single year of college until now, and we're only seperating because he's graduating this semester. That's all fine, but the thing that's getting to me is that we didn't spend any time together this semester. He was at the apartment maybe 2 weeks and 3 days of a 15 week period, the rest of it he spent at his girlfriend's apartment.

During the semester, I was fine with it. I got to talk with my friends online every day, whether that be my friends from home or you all here in JADS. I know how to cook, so I never went hungry or had to worry about groceries, and I mostly just kept to myself hanging out at the apartment. I liked the alone time or, at the very worst, didn't mind it. He still paid rent his rent. The few times he did stop by we had fun conversations. It was all fine during the semester.","",""

He stopped by to drop something off at the apartment office the other day, and he didn't even pop in to say hi.

I didn't mind during the semester, but now it's just getting to me. I guess I'm just realizing that we really did drift apart. Despite being literal roommates, we just stopped interacting since he wasn't ever home. My mom always told me he wasn't the best, and I've always defended him. He's my first friend, after all.

Sometimes people move on in their own way. It doesn't mean you can't still be close going forward, and he might have come to the same realization you have, or not. You have to find a new normal between you now if you want him in your life as his girlfriend is now a huge part of his that wasn't as much of a factor before (if she, or others before her, were at all). I think it makes a lot of sense that you feel this heaviness--you're mourning the loss of a friendship in a sense. It's not fully over. But it's changed.

It took me a while to come to terms that he and I no longer had the same connection we did before. Grief over that realization became this low, quiet resentment inside me. I thought, What did I do that made things this way?

Later on I ended up doing the same thing to many of my friends, once I got engaged and spent a lot more time with my fiance, her family, and her friends. I changed as a person, and I didn't realize how natural it can be to just drift away from people you care a lot about, especially when you yourself change. To me, it felt like a self-reinforcing wall; the further away I drew from them, the harder it was to try to hold on to the attachments I had left.

I don't know the finer details of your situation, but from my experience, I just want to reassure that the 'weird' feeling isn't indicative of a fault on your part, and to caution against letting that feeling make your decisions for you as to how you handle your relationship with him going forward.

I understand that he probably didn't mean for us to drift apart, but as most of you pointed out, it's still something sad that's perfectly normal to be upset about. Our families are friends with one another, so I imagine we'll still see eachother from time to time (we even vacation together), but I'm nonetheless kind of sad that our time as roommates and closer friends has kind of passed. We weren't super, super close all things considered, but he was my first friend: I was in Scouts with him and he's the reason I managed to muster up the courage to perform in musicals. Just thinking back on a lot of fond memories, and wishing that I had made more when the opportunity seemed to ripe, I guess.

The important thing to remember is that you know now and you can start taking things in a better direction. It's a process: not everything is going to happen at once and, at times, it may be feel painfully slow but things are going to get better.

Transition is not a one-size fits all, everyone is different and there is no correct script to follow nor any mandatory steps. It's up to you to decide what is most important for you to focus on. 

Socially, it can help to gradually start talking to your closest/most trusted friends about changing ways to refer to you and also ask for their discretion. It can feel nicer to already some people in your corner and ready to advocate for you before introducing the topic to a wider group of people.

Medically, this process is going to heavily depend on your location and medical coverage, so I'm not going to have specifics. But starting with talking to an in-network gender therapist is a common first-step, they'll be able to get you referrals to other services. There is usually a lot of frustrating waiting on this front, with things feeling out-of-your-hands at times, but keep with it and be ready to self-advocate if it's what you want.

It's not uncommon at all to have some to a lot of social transition before anything medical. Medical isn't always an option for everyone due to health concerns etc. or they just don't care to, but that doesn't invalidate their identity or anything.","",""

In this time I haven't made many friends here and haven't learned german to a comfortable extent. Because of the internet I still talk to my family and friends from argentina, but I still miss them greatly.
I had a regular check-up with my doctor today and got some not-good news related to my weight. It isn't like super bad, but I might have a fatty liver and she urged me to lose a lot of weight.
I don't know why exactly but that sort of triggered me. I've always been relatively fat but it hadn't been a medical issue until now. As she told me what kinds of food I should avoid I started realizing that's basically all I've been eating for the past few months (processed/fast food, fatty stuff like cheeses and oil, these kinds of things).

As I started thinking about how I basically have to restructure all my eating and excercising habits, I got really overwhelmed. It's really hard to do all that without a kind of ""support network"", and I started kind of doubting whether coming to berlin was a mistake. I've been telling myself I should endure it for a couple more years so I can get a citizenship, and then I'll be free to go back to argentina and come back here (or somewhere else in europe) if I feel like it, but I don't know anymore...

I'm earning good money here and my job is not too exhausting, but I also still feel like a ""tourist"" here... I tried learning german in classes or online, but I always end up falling off, and even though I have some friends here which I might consider _close_, I haven't met anyone that shares my interests, so I always end up spending a lot of time with my arg friends that do...

I just wanna spend some time talking in person about some random bullsht I'm interested in, but I don't feel I can do that with anyone here so I kinda want to go back to buenos aires but I know it's a really dumb reason so I'm not sure...","",""

What confused me about this was that, in the website where we track out grades, mine was currently listed as an A. I had gotten nothing but high marks on my assignments for the entire semester, and had performed very well in terms of quizzes and discussions. Looking at my attendance, it seems like I missed three classes, which, from want I gather, is what doomed me. According to the syllabus for this course, three absences fails you outright. Three.

I sent my professor an email about it to see if there was anything I could do, but until he replies I'm just gonna be an anxious mess. It seems absolutely unreasonable to me that I would completely fail a course despite having the highest letter grade possible because I missed *three days of class* in the course of *15 weeks.* It's just absurd. I could understand losing some points for going over three or maybe even having three or more, but failing outright is just unbelievable to me.

My attendance issues were at the very beginning of the semester, and now thinking about it just pisses me off. If I sunk myself that early because I was in a depressive rut, why the fuck did I even try for the entire semester? Why did I work so hard on those essays and try to hard to contribute to discussions? Why did I even come to fucking class if I was already over the paper-thin margin of error? I don't even have the words for that. This SAME PROFESSOR has a course with the SAME SCHEDULE and it takes *six absences* to fail that class outright. DOUBLE. It's fucking nonsense.

Every other class which I've taken - INCLUDING CLASSES BY THIS PROFESSOR - at least have some scale of punishment for absense policies.

To collect what I understand, you and your girlfriend are go to the same school, and you love her, and since finals are coming up, you want to let her focus on those by remaining a bit more distant so she can focus on her classes? If this is the case. Do you know why he gave her the bunny? It might have innocent reasoning behind it if there‚Äôs a reason behind it, like a holiday or birthday or something. If there is no reason and he did it randomly then yes, then yes I would also be worried. I think you have a good idea behind wanting to address it, but if you‚Äôre worried about bothering her during her finals, maybe what you could do is try to let her know that you feel uncomfortable with this guy giving her gifts and you want to discuss why he‚Äôs doing it after she does her finals and explain how you want to let her focus on her work. I think that if you‚Äôre sufficiently uncomfortable with this stuff happening, it needs to be something you two talk out, because ignoring the issue let‚Äôs it fester instead of be solved. If you wanna address the issue you gotta make sure that you come at it from the perspective of ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements. If you phrase the issue as you having a negative feeling and you feeling insecure, it makes the other person feel less defensive and more willing to hear you out. I think going public is a good solution to your issue because it would prevent other people from getting the wrong idea.

If you don‚Äôt solve issues as they appear in relationships it lets the issue fester and that‚Äôs worse then just ripping the bandaid off. Even if you can ignore how you feel this time, because you didn‚Äôt address the issue, you will now be more susceptible to feeling this way again over something else, and it‚Äôs possible you might even start resenting that you didn‚Äôt do anything. If you love her and she loves you then it‚Äôs worth addressing, as long as you don‚Äôt say anything insensitive and rude, handling it with an adult conversation; I think would go a long way to putting both your anxieties at rest and make you both understand each other better. Maybe you could meet up in person and talk it out physically whenever you have a chance, since that would be the best way to handle it.","",""

It could go either way. But if you don't ask you won't know and you'll wonder. Why does it have to be such a big deal that it's disruptive? I would just say to her: I know you're busy with exams right now, but something is bothering me, and I just have to ask--why did x give you that bunny? And if she gets upset for whatever reason: I just am crazy about you and I don't want to lose you because I didn't ask if I should be worried. I trust you but you're a great girl and other people will see that. I don't want to not ask you and worry silently, I thought you'd want to know that this bothers me, because it does. People don't usually give gifts for no reason. And if she brushes you off and says it was just a gift or a pre-exam nice gesture or whatever: okay, so I have nothing to worry about? Because I'd hate to lose you. Relationships are built on communication and maybe I'm being ridiculous but I thought you'd want to know how I feel.

It doesn't need to be a big deal or a fight between you or anything to distract from her exams. But not saying anything will only lead to you wondering and being defensive toward this friend of hers and might cause problems in the future. Or if something does come of it, will you wonder if you'd  talked to her about it sooner, she might have stayed with you? I think it's all in how you phrase it--you aren't accusing her, you aren't blaming her, you aren't saying that her friend would try to steal her away--keep it very positive, rational, and compassionate. Emphasize how much you care about her and that you don't want to lose her. Emphasize that you trust her. Emphasize that she's great and others are bound to notice. Try not to come off as jealous or paranoid about her friends, that's a huge turn off.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (2)"

If you don‚Äôt feel certainty that everything is ok now and you can‚Äôt let it go, it could fester deeper and deeper until the mole hill becomes a mountain.

I think what you‚Äôre doing is noble and a good effort, but remember to look out for yourself too. The best you can do is just keep reminding them to talk to a professional, and keep telling them that it would be ok, and it would get better. You can end up pushing someone away if you try and help them too hard, so you should be aware of that. Another thing I would suggest is having your friend try and set some boundaries with his family, let them become aware that he needs his own private space and time for himself, because he feels he doesn‚Äôt have any.

I SHOULD be more productive. WHY can't I just move forward like everyone else seems to. But you're just stuck. Best case scenario would be they are validated and can move on with treatment or they gain a new perspective. Very few people are beyond help. It's common, I think, to believe we're too far gone or therapy and medication will do nothing, but you don't know if you don't try. And don't you at least want to be able to say you really made the effort to get better? There are so many mentally ill people in successful careers, with families, or thriving lives.

Nothing you can do can replace the grief in their heart from the loss of someone in their life. If you just try and be emotionally there and supportive that‚Äôs the most I think someone could reasonably expect out of you. Try not to say I understand, cause unless you‚Äôve lost someone yourself you don‚Äôt understand and saying you do will probably not help. Try and keep close and check up when you can, but also if they want space give that to them too.

So then mentally it‚Äôs easier for me to cope with working 3, 4 hour shifts then a 12 hour shift. Another coping mechanism I use is to remind myself I‚Äôm being paid, if I keep reminding myself I‚Äôm being paid, then it‚Äôs easier to do the work mentally.

Just recently I quit my job and found a new one, because I was getting massive anxiety attacks and psychosomatic (I believe that's the term) sickness before work. 
At first I would wake up early to allot myself a bit of time to relax before work, and that worked pretty well for a bit, (this may or may not work for you) or as Mimi said, having something at the end of the day to make pushing forward easier.
My penultimate piece of advice may not be useful to you, but personally having been in the same situation a few times, if you get to the point of dreading your job that much, it may be worth looking around for other jobs. If going to work where you do makes you feel that bad, I usually take it as a sign to bow out before I burn out.","",""

It was confusing me how I‚Äôve had basically seven straight years now of abusive friendships and it‚Äôs likely a combination of really shitty luck and and upbringing that basically set me up to think I had no value beyond what I could provide to others, and that my emotions were only detriments in that, despite me feeling emotions for good reason. And 2 as a result I‚Äôm now kinda reexperiencing my latest abusive situation differently. Not only was there the deliberate love bombing to get me attached, it was leveraging a‚Ä¶ lifetime of feeling invalid. I thought she was supportive loving and validating, but of course, once I started feeling emotions, her own problems flared up and I feel back again into a situation of believing she was good, but she wasn‚Äôt, and that fantasy and lack of support kept me locked in.

I think though that you should use the failure as a jumping off point into motivation to do better. Sometimes failure is necessary to really put that fire under you to get going and succeed. Do not fret that you failed, try and focus on the next test, and try and focus on how you can do better on that one. It hurts to lose but its okay, we all lose sometimes, but what matters is how we go about getting back on track to success, I believe in you and your ability to succeed, I think you just had a bad run for this first exam. School puts so much emphasis on tests that mean nothing once you're done with the damn thing, so the best you can do is just buckle down and do what you can for them knowing that they're important but not make it or break it things. I hope you feel better and things work out better for you, and I wish you the best of luck on future classes, tests, exams or whatever else you gotta do.","",""

Its so easy to set yourself back when you make good progress, but I trust that you can keep going forward effectively. Sometimes the best way to move forward from negative experiences is to let old things be buried, thinking about that stuff too much can psych yourself out more then do good in my opinion.

Be kind to yourself, indulge in rest and self care and try to resist jumping full force back into your life. It's hard because you want to embrace that happiness and live it up, but you need to give yourself some time too. Just remember the toll it takes on you mentally. It's like you're coming out of a long illness where even the most basic things were exhausting and draining. But it isn't forever and soon, little by little, you'll recover.

Recognizing one's mistake is often difficult, more so admitting it, and even even more changing because of it. By forgiving them, you are not looking past the actions that they committed nor are you forgiving said actions. You are forgiving the person that committed it and recognizing their efforts to change themselves. Forgiving is different from forgetting.

For a long time you feared for your father's health and couldn't make him see a doctor, then when he did, it was bad news. Your mother, although hopefully doing better, has had her share of issues as well. And you don't have a lot of support for dealing with any of this, not to mention you had your own mental health issues to begin with. None of this is your fault. I think this world view is just the harsh reality of surviving difficult times in our lives.

There are always things we shouldn't have said or done. And the older you get the more they accumulate. Don't get caught up in them. We all have them. I'm older than you and I could sit here and just lay them on you one by one (but I won't). Don't feel you're a bad person for this. We all grow from them and learn and hopefully try to do better. There is enough you are dealing with already, don't add these to the pile.

Adult life is a lot of harsh realities and responsibilities. We get older and things change around us and we see things differently. But it's not all bad, especially if your childhood was less than ideal. In some cases the freedom of leaving home and a job among strangers is preferable to whatever you lived with under your family's thumb. But you aren't in a position to enjoy that freedom yet--you're in limbo still. Living at home, but expected to work and provide, and that's a hard place to be in. Even before you factor in the strained relationships, your grief about your father, or the fact that it hasn't been that long since he passed. You are so hard on yourself sometimes.

You trigger yourself to feel because your depression numbs you, or that's what I believe. It's a coping mechanism, maybe not the healthiest, but it's like a scab you pick at and I can understand why you would do it.","",""

It was better for him, I could see he was suffering. Well. I was not fine. I was a mess. And this was my uncle, granted my favourite relative, but not a parent like yours was.

it's a shame that hasn't actually helped with really improving those feelings at all.

I think I need to bring this up with my therapist more aggressively, because as-is, I feel like I go through cycles of ""good weeks/months"" and ""bad weeks/months"", where nothing really changes other than shit just sucks, or I have plenty of energy to do what I want but not for long enough for it to stay stable

While we were together we kind of got into a bad habit of overrelying on each other for all our social needs, we pretty much stopped talking in the friend group we met in, and after the relationship ended going back to normal social life was hard, and because of their mental condition it was extra difficult for them.

I feel like I made them quit because they weren't able to fit in, not many people talked to them, and also the old habits of our relationship started creeping into my mind again, I started overworrying about simple things, and hell, maybe I am overworrying right now, and it all made it difficult for them.

I spoke with my therapist more and am taking some action to look more into if I may have symptoms which are measurable enough to act on. Medical questionnaires, and discussions of the results at next appointment.

I don't know that I even have a grounded enough view of my own thoughts to answer some of these questions. As a case in point, there are questions probing for anhedonia, and if I answer with my gut, I feel one way, but if I think about it more, I don't know whether that's true, and it becomes hard to really know where it starts and ends.

For example: If I think about the things I do for fun (hobbies, etc), and spending time with other people for any sort of social connection (friends, family, literally anyone, etc.)
I would say I do get enjoyment out of those things, but if I think about it for longer than 5 seconds, I don't even know if that's true (which is probably not a good sign)

When I spend time with friends or family, I'm not simply enjoying it at face value and directly. 
I wouldn't say I really feel much at all on its own. 
It is nice to see or talk with people, but in the same way that having a different beverage once in a while can be tasty and nice, or washing your face with cold water can be invigorating. More in the difference that it makes with how I normally live day-to-day, than actually just enjoying it and wanting more. It's why I feel sorta like a oddball sometimes; I don't really feel craving of seeing other people, and even when I do spend time with friends/family, I can often feel... just sorta there. 
Of course I love and care for my friends, and I absolutely want them in my life. But when people do have to leave for whatever reason, it doesn't really feel like it hurts that much or really stir much of anything unless it's extremely sudden or severe.

For hobbies it's almost the same, if I try to do things I supposedly like, I'll just sorta feel like I'm going through the motions. Which isn't uncommon, but it's to an extent where, even things that I'd describe as ""I had a good time with this"", I don't know that I'd say I felt pure joy. It was always ""this is interesting"" or ""I'm pleased I did the thing I wanted to do"". I feel like I may not even really have ""fun"" with things I do for that supposed reason. Even when I'm interested or engrossed in something, I almost feel like it may simply be because it's something new to do; it's the cold splash of water, not that I actually just *feel good* from doing it.

So I'm starting to wonder if I've just sorta been gliding along, barely living in that way. I thought I was fine, but, I honestly don't know that I am anymore.
That being said, I'm not in some dire situation where it's so debilitating I can't do things. I can cook, do my chores, and am much more active than is typical for someone who has depression or similar.
Which feels like I am just being a little shit; I don't even have a good excuse of ""real"" mental illness (whatever that even means)","","ghosthug (1)"

A big example is that i'd probably say: I have not actually just ""had fun"" with any video game, watchable media, or similar in a longer amount of time than I can really be certain about remembering (>4+ years)

Doesn't mean that I don't enjoy things, but it's never as a raw ""that was fun"" sorta way; it's always in more of a ""i'm interested in seeing where this story goes"" or ""i have set my own goals around accomplishing things in this game, and feel satisfied when I complete those goals"".
Which means that there are just tons of things I want to do, but have essentially zero enjoyment of because the act of doing them isn't rewarding unless I either am intrigued by something about it intellectually, or am able to make progress to things that I want to do (e.g. get better at a fighting game, etc). Even then, it feels about the same amount of satisfaction as say: successfully checking off something on a grocery list.

So as some of you know I was in what I think was an abusive relationship, and I have a lot of mental health struggles grappling with everything that happened during it even now, two years after it ended. In fact, in about a week it'll have been exactly two years since I cut contact with my ex. That's not super relevant, but my point is that it's been a while.

Obviously, I have a lot of conflicted feelings which have made processing this and moving on from it. I was accused of a being a lot of things when we finally stopped being friendly to one another (sexually abusive, manipulative, controlling) and part of my struggle has been working through these accusations on a personal level. I used to meet with a therapist regularly and told her everything I could remember about the relationship and these issues, and she assured me time and time again that I wasn't some irredeemable monster and that I hadn't done anything wrong.

Logically, I know she's right. She's impartial, more experienced, and has no reason to lie. She has to be right, and yet my mind is just conditioned to doubt my own innocence endlessly. Thinking about it, I always doubt my own thoughts. Someone else has to be right. Someone else needs more. Someone else is better. I always find a way to put myself down. It's some kind of complex, I'm sure.

To give you can example of how my fucked up brain works: let's say that my brother stubs his toe. He wears his frustration very openly, and so he's going to express that pain and aggrivation. I'll ask him if he's alright, and he'll be honest and respond ""no"" in an annoyed fashion which is by no means directed towards me.
For whatever reason, my brain interprets my inability to improve his mood as a mistake. He's upset, I'm present, I couldn't help, so it must be my fault in some way. It's just... how I operate. It's wrong, and I don't get it, but it's the natural reaction for me.","",""

I blame myself even when I know I logically shouldn't, because that's just who I am. I can never really settle that inner conflict, but every once in a while I'll forget about it. Sometimes it's for long stretches, other times short ones.

I have a bad habit of checking up on my ex through her social medias as a result of this. A particularly unhealthy part of our relationship had to deal with my protective feelings towards her. ||One time, she told me that I had quite literally saved her life, because if we weren't in a relationship, she wasn't sure if she would have stuck around, so to speak|| (Suicide mention). I didn't realize it at the time, but this caused me to develop a mindset of ||""this relationship is the only thing *keeping* her alive.""|| You can imagine the degradation of my mental health as a result, especially when things started to get messy with lies and cheating towards the end.

I'm rambling again: here's the point. I checked up on her social media and I found out she's getting married. Assumedly she's marrying the person she cheated on me with, and... well, I don't know how or what to feel. I almost feel apathetic in a sense, but there's lingering anxiety related to that because I feel like I should feel something. I guess it makes me feel static. Like I'm in stasis as a person. She's moved on from me - moved on from me long ago - and in stuck here, still terrified of even making new friends and anxious at the mere thought of being in a relationship with anyone. I want to say that I feel pathetic, or that I feel angry, or jealous, or sad, or anything at all, but I don't. I just feel neutrally absent. Not good or bad.

Thinking people hate you because they don't interact with your posts or laugh at your jokes sounds like classic low self-esteem, but I obviously can't diagnose you, and if you feel like you manipulate people or don't feel like you have empathy for others, you should seek a professional diagnosis.","","‚òùÔ∏è (1)"

As far as the reactions, I‚Äôve found I tend to feel best when I have physical moments of true safety.

<@361153431009755154> Thank you for sharing you experience with me. It helps to know that this displaced apathy isn't a unique, unknowable thing that's only applicable to me. Like you said it's not exactly the same thing, but the sentiment and your response are the important part. I've had long stretches where I don't think about her for months at a time and feel relatively normal aside from my normal mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, the works). I know that this will pass like any other negative state of mind, but it's reassuring all the same to have someone share their own experience of a similar situation with me. Thank you.

<@272550723529605121> That dopamine fix you mentioned is something I'm very conscious of myself. Because of that relationship I've learned a lot of things, and the most important of all of them was that *anything* can become addictive. It's simply how the chemistry of your brain works. Get a positive response often enough with consistent enough stimulus and your body will start to crave it, nothing else to it. Weaning myself off of that desire to know how she's doing is a constant struggle, even years after. It almost scares me how strong that pull still is, and that it can still influence me to seek information that I know will only cause me more distress.

Allow me to be clear, however: I don't resent her. Maybe I should. Just like with your situation, I was also referred to as a convenience. I was a holdoff for something better. I was gullible enough to believe anything or anxious enough to grit my teeth and say I did, and that worked entirely to her favor. She cheated on me and got with someone new 4 days after we had broken up. I have every reason to hate her guts, but it's just not worth my energy anymore. That hate won't bring me anything good, and I don't intend to ever interact with her in any way, shape, or form anyway.","",""

Like I said, I blame myself for a lot of how things ended, and she blamed me for all of it. Coming from someone who I practically idolized for half a decade, it'd be impossible for me to shake my belief in her words that easily. They're burrowed into my mind, and my lack of clarity regarding what really happened has me doubting myself and believing her words since they seemed so sure. I suppose the right word would be gaslighting, but I don't know that I'm sure enough to put a label on it, especially one that gets thrown around so often. 

My point: I was terrified through and through that I had ruined her life and left her broken, but if she's able to keep moving and get engaged to someone then I suppose I can't have done that much damage if I even did any at all. It's a small solace, but it's one I'm going to take. I'll take whatever positives I can, really. Thank you for sharing your experiences with me. It means a lot.

I still didn't do what the others did before me, but we kind of made our own path around it all. So you see? We tried so much shit and got no where and finally we got somewhere but most importantly: I accepted that mental health was just a part of me that wasn't going to go away and I learned to adjust to the bad days and make the most of the good days. I found medication that works. I have professional supports in place to help. Do you see what I mean? Everyone is on their own path and does things at their own pace but mental health just fucks with that. So you have to find your balance and what works for you and put yourself on your own path so you're no longer stagnant. But I've been there, I really have. For too long. And I'm sorry you're stuck and I hope you get unstuck soon. Just remember all you've been through and what you're going through--they aren't. You can't compare to people who aren't where you are. It's just not fair to yourself to do so. And it's hard not to, I'm still working on this, but try to see the big picture.","","ghosthug (1)"

But when you are dealing with an invisible, but very difficult, illness and others aren't, there's going to be variance in your life and abilities and theirs. Do they get up in the morning with mental clarity and energy? Do they cry several times a day or week? Do they have supportive families and friends? Do they suffer from anxiety which makes life incredibly stressful? Or depression so debilitating even the most basic things are a struggle? Did they recently lose a parent like you did? Do you see what I'm saying? 

I used to go through my life, before medication and children, unable to get out of bed some days. Medication stopped me from yo-yoing every few weeks, so you can imagine what a relief that was, and how much stability it gave me. Recently, I began trying something new: for the first time in my life I started getting up early and exercising CONSISTENTLY before everyone wakes up. Which means I have a nice exercise high first thing in the morning to propel me through my day and I also get that stuff out of the way and can focus on other things. I am much more productive and energized. I still cycle with bipolar--that is never going to change--but I feel I'm getting more out of my ""good"" days. 

I say this because there are people out there who are not bipolar, or dealing with what you're dealing with, and this is their life. They get up. They get shit done. And some days are shit for them too. But it's not all the time. And you looking at them and then looking at yourself and being like: wow I'm shit because I didn't accomplish much in the last few years and they did--that's not fair to you.

It was a really unpleasant situation, to say the least - I told her I don't want to talk about a traumatic childhood experience, and she just stayed quiet for literally 20 minutes straight (I didn't say anything either, and this was during an in-person appointment that lasted 50 minutes in total), and just had me sit there and seethe. She didn't even get so much as an earful from her boss afterward. He just said that working on childhood traumas is normal in the type of therapy she provides, and didn't see anything wrong with her behaviour.

My support network now consists of my girlfriend, mother (I don't live together with either of them), and an assortment of Discord channels and users. I don't feel like this is fair to them - I know they have their own lives and they don't have any sort of responsibility towards me, and I tend to feel like a nuisance when I reach out to them.

I'm feeling horrible right now and I have nobody to reach out to because everyone is dealing with their own problems, and after my experiences with mental healthcare I don't really want to put myself through that system ever again.

Aside from rare, seemingly one-off feelings of enjoyment/happiness, I mostly feel at best neutral, at worst, actively having a shit time.

Just, always.
The way I would describe my own experience of life at this point is: saltines-and-tap-water.
I exist, but there is little in my life to warrant doing so on the positive spectrum. To put it another way: I can pretty easily work up negative feelings (anger, sadness, disappointment, etc), and positive feelings are essentially dried up for me. There is nothing I can do aside from drinking alcohol that produces anything that feels positive in the ""core"" sort of way that those negative feelings can feel negative.

Which just makes doing essentially anything feel like a chore, because even things I ostensibly enjoy, I'm just more likely to be annoyed, saddened, or generally disappointed by.
I have appointments to try and get traction on this medically, but if things don't shake out with something treatable with medication, I don't see my life going well for myself or others around me. I don't have the strength to push through what feels like a world where I'm up to my neck in packing-peanuts. I don't know *what* I'd do, all I know is that I'm not looking forward to it without something helping out in a direct way. 
Counseling/Therapy/etc doesn't change the fact that I feel this way, though at least it helps me identify I feel this way, when I previously just thought I was burnt out from work or something.

I'm sorry to hear about that incident occurring, that seems highly unprofessional from my opinion and I cannot imagine having to go through that sort of ordeal. I can understand the feeling of being socially isolated and its really hard to break out of. I cannot possibly begin to imagine the trans experience but I understand it must be really difficult and hard to discuss and deal with the hatred and pains that come with your identity, I don't know what it is like but I respect what you're feeling and it is valid. I am sorry it took awhile to get a response for this but I hope things have gotten better in the 5 or so days since you posted this message, It will get better and I believe in you. Sometimes even professionals cross boundaries and go too far, the best I believe you can do is tell them that they did that and not let them go there again. I would also consider finding another professional but I understand that it may be difficult to do and I'm sorry to hear about that. I dunno what else I would do in that situation as I've never personally dealt with anything like that, but I believe that if you just think things over you are a smart enough individual to figure out what you should do going forward. If you need someone to talk to about other mental health issues, there are safe spaces for you to do that sort of thing, and so I hope you feel comfortable enough to take advantage of those.

<@218764427032264704> 
I am glad to hear about that, just keep trying and pushing yourself like that, its always scary to do something big like that and I know that personally, but if you cant push yourself to get help or be helped or get better, no one else can do that for you. It can be scary, it can be hard, it can be expensive but if you don't do it then you will just be hurting yourself in the long run. I think something that might help in the mean time is finding hobbies or interests, cause those are really important and its good to have something to ground you and keep you in a better state. Regardless, I promise its gonna be fine and I'm sure its gonna be fine. I believe in you and I know you can believe in yourself too man, just gotta keep pushing forward, keep moving forward. You can do that. I hope you've gotten some progress in the couple of days since you posted this message.

That seems highly inappropriate and disrespectful of them to say something like that.

I think I can understand how that feels, its hard to control emotions when you go through stuff like that, especially when you're ill. I don't know what I would do in your exact situation, but what I try and do when I feel my emotions are severely controlling me is to just take a few minutes alone and try and ground myself. Grounding is usually good for helping me focus on logic and not emotions. I understand though that what I do might not apply to you, regardless I hope things get better and your mood stabilizes and gets better. If you quit something I hear the best way to not relapse is to fill it with something new, so find something new to do for the amount of time you smoke, or find out what caused you to get into smoking and address that specific missing aspect in your life or issue. I hope you can stay cold of that stuff cause its really bad for your health n stuff. I am glad you have quit it, and I am happy it has improved your mental considerably. I hope you don't relapse on the nicotine, but if you do, don't beat yourself up about it. Addiction is horrible and hard to kick, it can take a long time and a lot of work to quit something. You gotta be your biggest advocate y'know? You can do it, I believe in you.

<@694898966520659999> 
I understand how that feels, its such a universal anxiety and stressor, It will be ok. I am a similar person who overstresses and I know exactly what you mean when you talk about it. I am really happy to hear running is a hobby you have to release stress, I was going to suggest hobbies as a way to handle stress and anxiety but you're already ahead of the curve. Running is a really good hobby to have because it is both healthy and a very strong stress releaser, chemically speaking running does that sort of thing. I hope you can keep up with the running and I hope the exams go/have gone well! If they didn't its ok, its not that big a deal at the end of the day like you said.

<@983980935735312424> 
As someone whos been on both ends of that, I feel I understand what you mean. From the perspective of the other, I think its possible that they just might not have been able to keep it up, I know I've had people I personally held really dearly who I just didn't feel like I could keep contact with out of fear of hurting them or doing something that ruins them. None of that excuses the behavior, but I hope that sort of thing gives you some sense of peace for what you've been through. Its hard to lose people you care about, people you want to talk to, people you love, respect, adore, appreciate and just want around. It hurts, it leaves a hole in your heart, its painful, but time can only heal that hole. Time, and a strong support circle are the only things that can help that pain go away eventually. I hope you have people around you who support or can support you through what you're feeling. If you need someone to talk to there will always be people here who will listen publicly or privately. I can assure you that. I know it sucks though, its shit, its miserable, its hard, its painful, but you're a strong person, you are stronger then the pain. Im sorry that you have to deal with this but I know you are a person who can do this. One day it will be okay, I promise it will be okay.","",""

Change is hard, if change was easy there wouldn't be a billion dollar industry on telling people how to do it. I cannot speak for how exactly you should do it, but I can offer my ear and my heart. You are not a broken person if you don't let yourself be one. Change takes a lot of work and a lot of effort. I know it sounds so dismissive, but you just gotta keep trying, that's simply the truth in my opinion. The second you surrender mentally is the second nothing will change. You must not let yourself mentally give up, you gotta do whatever you can. Take pride in small victories be happy if you brush your teeth twice a day if that's what you need. No feat is too small to internally appreciate, nothing worthless about good. I also think you need to seriously go to a professional if you are having difficulties this sustained and deep because sometimes you have a broken knee, and no amount of willpower is gonna let you run on it. I know it may be hard or scary or difficult but if its something you need, its something you need, and neglecting it is only doing you harm because no one else can help you but yourself. I know it seems impossible but its not, you just need to push yourself to try because the first part is the hardest. I know you've dealt with a lot and I know you're going through a lot. Im sorry you have to deal with these things but it will get better

<@237753974390915072> 
I feel like what you are describing is depression. I know its hard to do anything about that sort of thing if it is depression, but I know you can do it. If it takes medications then it takes medications, if it takes therapy and time then thats what it takes. I think sometimes just talking or posting about what you're feeling helps, makes you know you're not alone in things, and not the only one in your head. I hear you, you aren't alone in this stuff. I am sorry you're in this mental state but I know things will improve and get better, because you are not a weak person, you are the opposite in fact. It just may take some time and pain to overcome this. I dont know exactly what I can do to help but I hope you can feel better knowing that you are heard and felt. Cause life can be better, it is a struggle but its not insurmountable.

Man I get it. Liars are shitty friends. I hope you can ditch bad friends like that. Those people can push you down bad roads.

This time a lot of things collided to create this bad stress/sleeplessness combo. I thought I've had a job interview in the afternoon, turns out it was at 8am. I've noticed this in bed after 1am. This led me to panic since the commute wasn't the shortest so at best I'd get 5-6h of sleep. This made me tense up even more, and I couldn't fall asleep for at least an hour. Then I woke up at 5am instead of 6, because I always stress about having my alarm wake up half the house.
All in all, I got 4h of sleep. 
After the interview I felt a lot of relief, got home and had some lunch. Then I got stomach cramps, presumably due to stress I've been going through.
After that I've spiraled into depression.
I've had a lot of thoughts about my brother getting a heart attack, because he has problems with heart and I've seen him dose off earlier. (I knew it wasn't real, but even then I was so scared, that I had to go check)

He wasn't nearly as lovely as yours is, but I felt I wanted out of the family and told my mother this. Instead of ""let's talk about it"" I got a shitty, gaslighting, manipulative TEXT (he couldn't even breakup in person) telling me he didn't want me in his life anymore and thought he'd been a good father. He was mentally/emotionally abusive since I was a kid and always minimized the issues I had--stomach pain? I was faking it (I actually needed surgery). Mood swings? Not bipolar, I just moved out too young (because of him largely). There was no respect, no support, just mind games and manipulation always. Sometimes I miss the good moments, because they did exist sometimes. I was closer to him than my mom. Sometimes I get angry that my children don't have grandparents and I can't pick up the phone and ask a simple question. Or I'm hurt they didn't fight for me--never in 5 years did he try to get in touch, say he was sorry, or try to make amends. So. Not all fathers are created equal. Not all are able to rise to the occasion. You are completely within your rights to cut contact, I did for less. You are allowed to feel whatever you feel this Father's Day (and every day, it doesn't save itself for holidays). It's hard when it's shoved down your throat so much: celebrate Dad! I don't have a Dad anymore, so love yours harder! What are you buying your father this year? Are you visiting? I see it all too. I just tell myself that I don't have a father anymore, by mutual choice, and if mine were like other fathers that might have been different. If he loved me, it wasn't how I needed to be loved, and he has his own problems, so I try not to demonize him. It is what it is. But it's hard sometimes. Keep your foot down and don't let him in.

So last week was already bad. Like we ate together one time and I tried to at least keep a bit of a conversation but she didn't even try in the slightest. Then she wrote down that she would be absent for a few days of the week, even though she was home those days (in hindsight), and the other days she would cook but just leave the food in the kitchen for me to fetch myself. So yeah not very nice of her to do that but she was very busy that week, so I thought that was probably it. But then I cooked dinner yesterday and...","",""
"405519096055332864","dis_ely1","2022-06-21T11:56:26.5460000+00:00","So I cooked dinner I thought we would eat together and I texted her 'Dinner is ready' to which she respoded 'I have other plans'. So, even though I had done it multiple times earlier in the day, I checked to see if she had written down that she would be absent and yes it was there but, it was small, somewhat faded, and near the edge of the board. So I texted back 'next time could you be a bit more clear cause I didn't see it' and she immediately responded with 'or you just look better'. And then she drew a big line on the board with and arrow at the end, which I can only interpret as 'I won't be joining dinner this week and onward'. 
So to me asking her if she could be a bit more clear when she wouldn't be there for dinner she basically said ""fuck you I won't be there for dinner any time soon, is that clear enough for you?!!"". I don't know what's going on with her, like does she hate eating with me so much that she foregoes basic politeness of telling me that she just wants to eat alone. Or is there something else for her to act, imo, in such a shitty and unkind way. 
Note that she could be gone  for the rest of this week and the next and that's why she won't be joining for dinner, but as far as I know she'll be home and just doesn't wanna eat together with me anymore. Also note that if that's the case she didn't like say that directly to me, no she drew a big line on a board in response of me asking her to be a bit more clear when she wouldn't be joining dinner.

It seems like she doesn't want to be with you that's for certain. Maybe she has stressful circumstances, maybe she hates you, be it one or the other it doesn't really matter. 
I agree that the way she's acted was rude and pretty hostile, but idk the circumstances, so I'll withhold the judgement. 
From what you've said it sounds like you're bothering her too much and asking too many questions. Normally there shouldn't be a problem with that, communication is important, but you may come across as needy.

There are two ways you could handle it: try to read the room, and don't bother her. It doesn't seem like she's harming you, so leaving her alone could work fine.
The other way is to ask her of you're bothering her, or if the eating together thing just doesn't work for her.

Mom came home and the first thing she's told me is that she'll kick me out if I'm not working by September. She's told me I'm a parasite, who's happy to just sit around and do nothing. 
I've been to another interview 6 days ago. According to her I'm slacking and if I was giving it my all I would already have a job.
It's so fucking disgusting to hear something like this, especially from a parent. 
I know I haven't been doing my best, but how is this fine? She's told me I'm a fuckup since I've graduated from hs, and that father would be rolling in his grave if he knew. 

She wasn't sober, and I was very pissed, so I told her she can't just kick me out of the house (I own a part from the will), to which she said I'm not entitled to anything, and she'd change the will... (Not possible, but it really illustrated the point that she hates my guts) Things got dicier than I'd like. No matter what I say, it would get worse. 
I've payed her rent since father passed. Now my money is almost gone, since the last job I've had ended in February, so I can't pay her much more. This is just bad.

She's told me the worst mistake I've made was quitting the previous job, because according to her I've had no reason to. So I told her I've quit because I've had such a bad depression back then that I couldn't even do anything. Of course she didn't believe me. And told me I've lived through nothing, I have no right to be depressed.

On friday I randomly met them again on the server we initially met. They had a new account but It turned out to be them. We talked for like 6 hours, they admitted to lying to me and the lies piling up were getting too much to handle so they bailed. Also said they cant stop thinking about me and I'm the first person they actually fell in love with for real and such things. They pretended to be someone they want to be because society doesnt let him/her be that way and getting some validation online before eventually disappearing, Quote ""I hate who I am IRL so much""

I offered a clean start and being friends since I enjoyed our talks too much to really be angry at them and everything seemed okay. Then saturday passed without a single message from them again and this morning I basically found out they had left again and blocked me and deleted half the messages posted.  I feel like a fool for actually worrying about this person and I know its not my place to help/fix someone elses life but they seemed to genuinely suffer and I just wanted to extend a hand in friendship at the very least.

I used to be part of a private little discord server for Hearthstone (so yeah, a long time ago since I've long quit that game entirely) -> and one of the members was a toxic jerk. The admin/server owner refused to ban him because ""oh, that's too harsh"" despite the toxic jerk being openly insulting to everyone as well as straight up openly racist, like full on racist with no deniability, and stuff. What he'd do is whenever everyone started openly complaining about him, he'd just not post anything for a week or two -> come back as if he's innocent of any wrongdoing -> and do it all over again.

Frankly, I posted one long paragraph on how this is the stupidest situation to be in -> and frankly just left. My DMs are only open to friends on discord, naturally unchanged even to this day, but I did unfriend everyone from that server which is kinda effectively blocking them.
In my paragraph, I included some sentences directly to the admin/server owner that if he's unwilling to do what it takes to protect the community he has put together, then he has only himself to blame when it falls apart. Maybe he learned from that lesson but who knows? I never looked back because the only memories that I have of the place is how toxic everything was because of that one person.","",""

Idk, I feel wrong about feeling wrong about it. I feel possessive even if I haven't interacted with them in a while.

It's good that you recognize the feeling isn't healthy, but there's no use feeling guilty for your emotions. In my opinion, it's a really natural reaction, and you're not a bad person or unusual at all for feeling it. In fact it's a really positive sign, to me, that you've identified the feeling as something you don't want, and you're trying to process it rather than letting it influence your behavior. Stay mindful of it, and it might take longer than you'd like but it will fade with time. It did for me.

Like you say, feelings are feelings. It's really hard to disentangle yourself emotionally from someone you had a deep relationship with, it might never be quite as clean as you'd like. But that absolutely doesn't reflect that there's anything about you that's at fault.","",""

I have an appointment scheduled another 3 weeks from now with a psychiatrist which should result in a treatment plan, but the time until then has been intolerable to be honest.

After doing more research on my part (using NIMH, and similar resources), I am nearly certain that I have undiagnosed Major Depressive Disorder (granted, not a medical professional, but I am an engineer for a living, and a PHQ-9 score of 14 supports my conclusion, at least some). Which is ""good"" in that it's very treatable, but even if everything was incredibly prompt, I could only expect improvement by around September.

Which just feels... Impossibly far away, especially when my own mindfulness has made my own mental state all the more painful; since I understand what I'm feeling better, it feels more intense than when I was simply unaware

The worst part is that I feel more than ever that nothing I do makes me *feel* anything really, and if I do, it's either barely anything at all, or intense but negative

Which just makes it feel pointless to bother doing anything. Want to watch something? It just feels like I'm sitting there watching a screensaver, or I am actively annoyed by it. Want to play a game? At best, it's a really interactive checklist that perhaps makes me use effort to check the boxes.

I end up feeling like I have brainrot; do I even know what ""fun"" or ""enjoying something"" actually means anymore?

It's just really wearing away at me","",""

He's on vacation right now and I have been giving him space for almost 3 weeks now; I'll be able to reach him again on Sunday. This time we're only gonna talk if it's on a call, and I bought a Webcam for the occasion to break down the online barrier as much as I can.

The just world answer is fuck those friends. If they can‚Äôt support you as you are in your worst movements they don‚Äôt want you as a person. They are the ones that should care for you if they really care for you. Humans are social creatures and relational healing is a BIG part of healing mental health issues.

If you are going to get into a relationship where you partner does love you then I'd expect they would want you to get better in the parts of your life you might be lacking so why wait until a relationship comes for that. And lastly, and most important, if you don't get 'the point' of friendships I honestly doubt a relationship is gonna help you. Don't be dismissive of people just because they can't give you exactly what you need. There's no need to single out women particularly either, you don't know every woman on the planet.

Well, the thing is, once I got friends, **that didn't change**. I had friends, and they were cool to hang out with and they were fun to be around, but the anxieties didn't go away. My friends were kind, and understanding, and I won't say that they didn't help me somewhat, but the crux of the issue is, even though I thought friendship would fix me, it didn't.

This destroyed those friendships, because **it isn't your friend's or romantic partner's job to constantly have to prove to you that you matter**.

**Find Friends**
Friends will be able to give you more happiness day to day, they‚Äôll be able to give you functional advice, they can build your social skills, and they can *support* you when you‚Äôre down.
**Self Improvement**
Everyone looks different so hard to really be specific here but hopefully that‚Äôs what the therapist/psychologist is doing for you. Helping you realize what aspects you want to improve then they can give pointers on how to achieve that. They can also help you socially!
AFTER BOTH STEPS
**Finding Prospective Partners**

I've been reading the chat for a good while now, doing my thing as a moderator and honestly Dark, here's my opinion:

From what I can tell, you're trying to find someone to complete you, not compliment you. That's not how a relationship should act, a partner compliments you. 

I'll also say, earlier you said you wanted to skip the friendship bit and go right into a relationship. That's not how relationships work. People who skip the 'friendship' part are often looking for a sexual relationship, which I can see that's not what you want. I get wanting someone next to you, we all go through that, but for that to happen, you'd need to understand that starts at a friendship. And yes it's hard talking to people but the more you put yourself down, you're just making it harder for yourself to find friends.

Find happiness in friendships with no expectations of anything further. That's my recommendation.","","üëÜ (9),üíØ (4)"

A relationship isn't just to only make you happy, you also have to put in an effort to make the other person happy and they have to do the same for you. A relationship is also about mutual understanding and being able to tell each other things that you aren't able to tell other people and then being able to have someone who cares and listens and that you can feel comfortable with.

I do not think that you should continue to be in contact with your crush. I can imagine that the very concept sounds like a non-starter, but let's consider a couple factors here. The most important thing in any situation regarding ment health is how you feel and how something or some*one* **makes** you feel. 

You have said yourself that this person seems to you like an improved version of yourself. I can say from the start that this sentiment is one which is ultimately harmful. This is going to sound obvious and stupid, but please consider it to the fullest: no one can be you except for you. There is no better or worse you which exists in the present, there is simply *you.* The only benchmark which should ever be applied to oneself with regards to self-worth should come from within. Even if your lives seem similar, even the most minute of details - the smallest change in the chemistry or history of a person - creates a wildly different individual. It's useless to compare yourself to another in that capacity, because it is an objectively unattainable benchmark.

I have more to say on this topic, but I want this to be more readable so I'm going to break this message up a bit.","","‚òùÔ∏è (1)"

We know that you think she's a better you, but consider the kind of feelings which that may impart. It has the potential to inspire you, sure, but judging by how you're expressing yourself it would seem that rather than uplifting you, this comparison is pushing you down. You see in her all the things that you aren't, and the absence of those qualities causes you to feel that there is something wrong or missing in you that has. (Please stop me if I'm overreaching on this statement, but from what I've read it sounds accurate to me).

To put it simply, being around her or in her circle makes you feel like shit. Regardless of your feelings *for* her and your desire *for* her, the feelings she inspires *within you* are ones which ultimately only serve to worsen your life. You cannot live in someone else's shadow forever, comforting as the shade may be. It's comfortable because it's familiar, not because it's right.

Cutting contact with someone you have strong feelings for is painful. It is an excruciating process which will make you doubt your motivations dozens of times before you have even one moment where you see the benefit of it. I won't lie to you: if you choose to do this, it's going to fucking suck. A lot. It's gonna hurt, and it's gonna feel like you're missing some fundamental aspect of who you are as a person.

But ask yourself this: would you rather let an infection fester, or would you wanna deal with it and grit through the procedure to come out better on the other side?

I personally believe that continuing to foster a relationship with your friend is only going to continue to hurt you as time goes on. Cutting contact with her is not a matter of ""not talking to her because she doesn't have sex with you."" Anyone that frames it that way, yourself included, is interpreting the situation without any nuance. This is about you and your mental health. Having her in your life is actively harmful to your mental health, and that kind of harm cannot be sustained.","","‚òùÔ∏è (1)"

For the long one I'd have to clarify that I'm not a believer in 'the one'. I think people are far too complex and flawed to have a single perfect match so now that we understand we have several compatible options they could honestly be anywhere. Although I only have gotten into relationship with people introduced by friends I've gotten into quite a few intimate friendships in pretty much every way there is. Be it classmates, online forums or at social place. To me dating apps force interactions between people without any real reason other than to talk where as elsewhere, be it by circumstance or a genuine shared interest you have a starting point to talk/interact with someone.","","üëç (1)"

Being in a relationship is not about being a perfect match; it's about both parties being mature and loving enough to bridge the gaps where they appear. I've been married for a few years now, and I know very many older couples-- as an in-home caregiver I am *very* familiar with several of them. You never stop learning new things about your partner, and many of those things that you learn you may not like much at all. Once you move in with someone, there will be trials one way or another. No perfect ""the one"" exists where that is not the case.
It might be worth mentioning, as well, that the grass is always greener on the other side. Don't give up on your relationship just because it's not perfect; any other one that you can have is going to have its own issues, possibly worse ones. That kind of thing is up to nuance and discretion; there are very good reasons to leave someone. But, from what I've seen, partners that can make it through (reasonably) rough patches are the ones that end up the happiest couples going into their later years.
No relationship is never going to take  some hard work (excuse my double negative). And no matter who it is, you need to be patient, and hope they are patient with you.","","üëç (4)"

Talk it out with her, confront her about it.

So yeah, have a diagnosis and treatment plan including medication which should help

Which is comforting I guess? Still going to take time for change to happen even with medications, so it's a work-in-progress and will be for a while.

I have friends I talk to every day where we have the same dynamic.

Going more than a week without talking to my abusive friend was hell. How could I want less communication, she did too, and less communication felt like hell? How could I not handle a relationship like her friend of 15 years where they talk once every four months? 

It‚Äôs because she was abusive towards me. It was an unhealthy relationship based on intermittent rewards, lack of boundaries/respect and deliberate lying in order to craft a narrative.

First I want to empathize with you, late last year I got out of a toxic relationship that to this day I can't fully claim it was abusive, some days it is and some days it isn't. Not having people to truly know what I felt made me question myself and how I was treated, I still do. And honestly its not like life was doing me any favors either. I was (am still) broke, I am a student that can't help themselves lose one or two courses every semester and it seems like there's no place for me to find a job. I've lost most friendships I had a year or two ago, the ones I still talk to I don't seem to trust anymore, not like I used to at least. And yet I live in a loving household that, even if they can't grasp what I'm going through, they try their best to keep my chin up. Getting a job would be great but I'm privileged enough where it isn't needed. So there's 'nothing' in front of me stopping my actions and yet I feel like I can't move. I'm both at a privileged spot in which I can indulge in my laziness but also I'm a lost kid, afraid to go any further than my kitchen to grab a meal.","",""

And after looping the same thoughts for almost a year all I can say is try. I should clarify first, you're not entitled or selfish for wanting more out of life. I mean, if you feel like you're life is at a pretty bad spot, why would it ever be wrong to want better things for yourself? And if you want to remain by yourself for now, that's fine too. Even though what happened to you is in the past, its weight is ever-present, you said it yourself. So if you still feel vulnerable and don't want to open you're in your right to do so, recognize that even though you're no longer in imminent danger you're still bruised, and so you must heal. Everyone heals different, so find whatever's healthy for you. But do push yourself, at your own pace, into living again. Because there is comfort in sadness and I'm worried you're gonna get stuck in a loop fighting yourself over what you think you should be doing and what you're really feeling.","",""

After dealing with a messy situation in which none of use are to blame but both are involved, she told me that one day, she ran up on me (I didn't notice) and she got a panic attack right after seeing me. She has nothing against me, but I remind her of some of the worst things that ever happened to her. By pretty much losing most contact with her I lost my only emotional outlet which to be fair, wasn't too healthy either. So friendships and relationships have been a touchy subject since then. And to that, I gotta be honest. I don't really know the answer. Maybe someone else can answer that for me. I only know that, for as little as I kept in contact with my friends, even if I couldn't find the strength to talk to them about how I feel thanks to me not trusting people I still found glimpses of hope and joy in the kindness of their actions.

Todays just‚Ä¶ really been hard‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ I am stuck in these death spirals of fear. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I struggle with close relationships. I have my one close friend, and just moved from my growing group‚Ä¶ I got out of that toxic town but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so much harder without that community. I death spiral. And anytime I make a hard choice like today I have EVERY doubt in the book about what I‚Äôm doing. Am I the monster. Was every insult right. Am I overreacting. What is even real. 
My mother said she is open to help but she didn‚Äôt fight hard to talk to me‚Ä¶ probably one of the better outcomes. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ no matter how much she tries I know how she feels. I know what my relationship with her was like, how she sees the world, how I felt in that world.

Her kind words of improving are nice, but I know by her actions they are sweet nothings. I‚Äôve faced‚Ä¶ YEARS of sweet nothings from friends and over a decade from my mom (likely how I developed tolerance and wishful thinking over the friends). I won‚Äôt let myself fall victim to it again. I‚Äôm tired of putting myself into the back burner for everyone else‚Äôs needs. I‚Äôm suffering damnit. I want to vomit anytime I talk to my mother. I have every reason to not want that in my life. 
And yet I still have the thoughts that I‚Äôm no different from my abuser. That I was the overreacting crazy person. 
I wish I knew what reality was‚Ä¶ 
Thank you for commenting on the hope I feel. You are right. I‚Äôve dealt with‚Ä¶ so much shit. Yet I‚Äôm still here. I don‚Äôt know why. I really don‚Äôt. But I am. Something is pulling me forward, in little pieces.","",""

The closest thing that I can attribute to that source of anxiety is imposter syndrome, specifically the ""expert"" classification from this article https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one.

I was on my way to becoming a journeyman plumber which is a big thing. But then I started to look back at my experience and realized that maybe 80-90% of the work that I've done being a plumber in those 4 years of work wasn't even plumbing. Out of the entire company (fluctuating around 10 to 20 people) I was for the majority of the time relegated to doing firestop, making the holes, cleaning, moving shit around, chipping concrete, and a fuckton of other tasks. I know that all of those tasks needed to be done for a job well done, but ffs when you push all of that shit to one person they don't cultivate the experience and knowledge that is required to be a competent plumber. While I was doing that, my coworkers that I felt where in the same hierarchy bracket were doing the real shit. They're tasked with piping up a whole floor by themselves, figure out and do an entire gas piping system, be left doing an underground, and more. Seeing that difference in experience just fucked me up mentally.

I am not a confrontational person, so I let things fester and hope that the feeling or situation eventually peters out. But it didn't and I left a few months before I was qualified in taking the journeyman's exam.","",""

I have aways had issues on involving myself romantically with people since i was a teen and have tried a few times only one of these led to anything more than a week and honestly i learned absolutely nothing from it. 

I keep thinking on all the problems that can happen on asking her out and if she rejects and all that,i dunno and its like so much pressure i am placing on myself and like even if we go on a date how do i proceed i never even went to a date with anyone and like i really dont want to blow it because honestly its the first opportunity i have had in like 4 years wich i keep thinking might not lead to anything wich might take more 4 years and what then more 4 years?

And like i have very little to none positive experiences on interacting on a romantic level with someone and just keep thinking and thinking that i might blow it or might like be suboptimal or i dunno. And honestly im the kind of person who really doesnt like stressing about stuff but beeing lonely for my life and never finding someone is something i aways feel anxious for.  My psychologist said i should follow my heart but i dont know how to do that i am a absurdly logical person wich is good sometimes but is bad in this case and this is something i really cant ""logically"" know because i legit dont have enough experience and probably never will have if i continue this kind of circular thinking.

Either way TL:DR i am scared of romantic interactions because i might be: Bad a them,get rejected,have problems due to lack of experience,generally shy? in these cases (im not really sure on this one) and theres also the pressure of like beeing the one to ask someone out it kinda becomes your responsability for the date to work.","",""

1. When you're asking her out, be very clear to her that it is a date - too often do I see ""hey do you want to hang out"" which can lead to confusion. It's going to be awkward and you're going to be nervous as hell doing it but it's a part of it unfortunately.
2. My favorite types of first dates are walks or just generally being outside, grabbing a bite of food along the way - usually talking about things gets nerves chill. Avoid movies or similar things where you don't interact a lot!! 
3. You definitely do not need to push something the first date, that's if both people are comfortable with it and if you're not great at reading those signs then it's better to just take it very chill :)","","üëç (1),‚òùÔ∏è (1)"

I'm gonna be starting my next semester of college soon! In a sense, I think that makes this anxiety the good kind. The ""this is important to me, so I'm hoping I do well!"" kind, y'know? Got a lot of things to be worried about, even though I know they'll turn out fine in the end. New roommate: seems like a cool guy, seems like he matches my energy and pace pretty well, seems like things will generally be perfectly alright with him. Honestly, in just kind of worried about... well, I guess about having someone else in the apartment and not wanting to seem like a recluse. 
I spend most of my time in my room, which makes sense considering that most of friends are only accessible there while I'm at school. That said... I'll be honest, I don't know how to physically interact with someone in this kind of context. Do I try to hang out in the same room as them? Do I strike up a conversation if we see each other or if they're in the other room? Is it weird if I don't talk to them for a while or if I'm just by myself for most of the day? I don't know. I'm sure I'll figure it out, but I just don't wanna be a stranger to this guy because it seems like a good opportunity to make a new friend, and I want to at least make one at school. I've made plenty of friends here, of course, but... well, I'm sure you all know that it's different online. Not worse, not better; different.","",""

I lucked my way into testing out of Spanish 101 (literally hit the exact score threshold to pass) and now I'm just scared that I'll be clueless in class and just flunk completely. I need at least 9 credits foreign language to graduate, and I'm hoping to graduate in two semester. That means I need to pass this unless I want things to get complicated.
Again, I'm sure I'll be fine. I have friends who know Spanish. I'll have a professor, and a textbook, and classmates - the whole kit and kaboodle - but... well you know how anxiety is. So convinced I'll fail even when I know I haven't before.
So uh... yeah. Feeling a little anxious. Much less so than when I started typing, but still anxious. If you have any advice regarding my roommate, it would be greatly appreciated. I get the feeling I come across as a great people person, and while I know people like me and I enjoy conversations and interacting with others, I also feel like any time I initiate it myself I'm being a burden on others. Leads to a lot of situations where I just... won't talk to friends for a bit. I'm great in a group context, not so much 1 on 1. So again, anything helps.","",""

I think that above all things you should talk about some of your habits at first. Personally that helps me frame the other person's personality before having to spend the time to know em.
So back in the small apartment with one roommate I had a bit of an icebreaker convo with the guy where I politely asked if he'd be around the house or not, if he slept earlier than me, etc. I think it's safe to say that you don't need me to tell you that communication is key so go back and forth with your roommate so you can set rules and know each others habits.","",""

I talk to new people, and then that's it. We leave and I never see them again. And it always feels like everyone else already knows each other, too. I think that sometimes they don't actually already know each other but they're all just getting along well with each other before I show up, but other times they literally do all know each other and it's an established friend group and I find it hard to join in. I find it very hard to join conversations in general. I always feel like I have nothing valuable to add, or even anything I could say at all just to say something. All I can ever come up with most of the time is saying ""yeah"" after someone says something, which I don't do because that would be stupid. But I do force myself to join in because I know I have to, and after enough awkward standing around and waiting for someone to talk at me it goes well and I do successfully take part in the conversation, but then I still never or rarely see any of them again.

Am I just supposed to go ""ha ha this was fun we should all hang out again sometime"" and then they all look at me as if I think they all just met each other too? No?

As a result, today I heavily ignored my remote work, I didn't eat anything, just played that game and felt awful for ~13 hours. 

I can't stand how much of a useless piece of shit I turn into constantly. It's like my capacity for executive functioning has been shot for the past month or so, I've barely been able to get any of my chores done, I'm constantly having to make decisions as to which clothes of mine are the LEAST dirty to wear, I'm just a fucking wreck. 

This kind of panic has me thinking that I need to quit my job ASAP, not because the job or the people itself are an issue, but because I just can't maintain the level of consistent executive functioning to actually do my work regularly. I'm constantly running into phases of procrastinating on my work for so long that I can barely keep up with my deadlines, and am always behind schedule. 

I don't know any avenue to unfuck myself at this point, but it's so exhausting to have a few isolated good days that make me feel capable, then to immediately revert into slovenly goblin-esque living.

I have countless people here who I look forward to talking to on a daily basis, endless entertainment to look forward to on account of the wealth and diversity of interesting conversations, and the simple, plain comfort of having a shared space with many people whom I consider friends.

I've been stuck in a limbo for years now where I switch between a happy-go-lucky guy or feeling like I'm less than a shell of a human being. To this day I haven't found out what the fuzz for friendships is all about. I've really tried to connect with others but I'm unable to attach myself to someone for that long. The friendships that I have kept are all... warped, for lack of a better word. The dynamics, the times we tried going out every week, that burning passion to spend as much time as humanly possible its mostly gone by now. And because of my obsessive behavior I try to figure why I keep failing at relationships and friendships and the only commonality I find is that I stop wanting to bother people because that's what I feel I am. A bother. 
And while sure, I have talked to people these past few months I haven't really talked to someone directly. So even when I'm surrounded by people I'd consider friends I start to feel like I'm alone again, only this time I'm alone in a crowd. And this bug, this itch, doesn't let me sleep. I think about all the times I could have interacted with someone, all the times I didn't ask someone how were they simply because I didn't feel like it, I couldn't. I think how long its been since I told my family that I love them.
Today I had a proper shit day, its been awhile since everything falls into place to make me feel miserable. And you know what? It does inspire to strive for better days, this might not be my happiest period moment in my life but I still have people who support me, the necessary tools and the privilege to not have any crippling health barrier that stops me.

Mental Health is a chat for people to discuss their turmoil and support others.

It doesn't feel right to unthinkingly shut down a person airing their mental problems in the chat made specifically to let them do that. In the future if anybody feels that such talk is getting too specific / intense / direct, please try to contact mods about it instead of policing it yourselves - chances are we are already discussing if it's gone too far (as was the case here).

Ultimately we want to keep this channel going smooth and safely for those that need it, even if that might invite unpopular lines of thought.","",""

You may know that my game finally opened a steam page with a huge chunk of demo and I‚Äôm working hard on the project so that I can release it at the right time. It‚Äôs quite busy, but that‚Äôs not the problem, since I am a natural born workaholic anyway. 
My problem was that my expectations were too high when I uploaded the demo. You see, the demo is actually 1/3 of a full game and it is designed to be replayed more than once, so I thought it would do enough job to build a large group of players before the release. A lot of jads people who played this game said it was mostly fun so I thought it could work, like some other indie games‚Äô cases. 
Turns out, only 200 people have tried it so far(it‚Äôs been more than a month) and even then, only 40% of people have passed the 10% mark of the demo. Were there positive feedbacks or influx of new players? Yeah, but only a handful. One thing I painfully realized is that Word of Mouth is overrated and even if they have played it, not many players will say a single word about it. 
Where are those 180+ people who have abandoned the run? What‚Äôs their opinion? What‚Äôs their feedback? Did they have fun with it? How did they play it? I‚Äôll never know. 
As a game developer, watching people having fun with my creation is the only goal of living. It makes every pain and endurance fight worthwhile. Yet the fact that it is not gaining enough attentions and I cannot know the players reaction makes me so frustrated. 
What about marketing? You would say. Well, I keep working on it, but the fact that getting rejected/ghosted by some publishers, contest and content creator channels gave me serious insecurity issues. I suddenly felt like I‚Äôm not a notable developer. 
I just belong there -the pile of mediocre platformer games and their developers stuck in their bubble. 
And on twitter I keep finding other developer who seemingly started the project recently and somehow got more views and more influencer love calls. The toxic jealousy overwhelmed me. I want their audiences, I want their shiny visual style, I want their slick stuff, etc. Now the jealousy is so strong that I feel easily frustrated when other devs get chances or be successful, even if I supported the devs long time ago. 
And so my brain is occupied by this unhealthy mindset and hyper fixation on my project. The influence is so strong that I don‚Äôt know how to talk about other topics other than stupid meme shit and this also makes me feel really lonely at the end. I feel like I made my own social jail, and this won‚Äôt likely be fixed until I can resolve the feeling about the troublesome development and vacant feedbacks.","","ghosthug (36)"

That's still my stance, and even though it isn't exactly making waves on Steam, its also a really big market you're entering, with a lot of other Indies to compete with. 
The Indie scene is a tempestuous place, but among all other things, Quality and Effort is what will make one game stand out from the crowd. And from what I've seen, there's plenty of both on display in the Demo. It might take time for people to become privy to that, but I've got faith that your hard work is going to be reflected in the finished product.","","joeHeart (1)"

I've personally worked on several jam games though, but I can't imagine the effort that must go into making a full game- _specially_ when working alone. I've also been in that place where I get super mad when I make something I believe to be great, and it doesn't get the reception I'm expecting. Not sure if you just want to vent, but if you're looking for recommendations here are a few that have helped me in the past:
1. Marketing is super important, but also harder than it looks and you may have to post for a long time before you get noticed. Seeing the brand twitter you have, I think you're on a good track, but I'd try to keep the videos shorter and have some sort of hook to keep people watching. I haven't played the demo yet, but I've seen some clips and the huge purple train boss is really eye catching. If it has some intro animation, the start of that battle would be a really cool clip for twitter. Also, make frequent calls to wishlist on steam, a high wishlist count is like the number 1 way to get your game noticed when you don't have a publisher.
2. As for feedback, I'm not sure if you've had somebody do dedicated QA yet, but for me the best way to do it was always just give the game to someone and watching them play, letting them talk but without providing answers. Just watch how they behave and what frustrates them in the moment, that usually gives you a pretty good idea of what issues the game actually has. If they have suggestions, listen them out, but trust above all what you see in the live testing (unless it's some common complaint that you're missing)

Again, sorry if you're not looking for recommendations, I don't know if I came off like a bit of a douche, maybe you already know all this. I love the look of this game and am looking forward to playing it when I have some time!","","joeHeart (1)"

I recently was DMing for a DnD game that I thought was going pretty well. We had our issues and complaints, but overall I believed the group and I had a net positive experience considering we‚Äôre just a college group with little time to get together. But then at the start of September I was told to meet with half my group, 3 women in total, for some unknown reason. They wouldn‚Äôt tell me why or how this meeting was decided, only I had to meet them despite telling them my anxiety at the prospect since they made it seem very serious. I wanted them to tell me more, but in the end I decided to meet with them the day before classes started back up for us. During the ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù they confronted me with a list of all the ‚Äúterrible‚Äù things I had done or implied throughout the campaign, which had been running for almost a full year. Then, from my perspective, they proceeded to belittle me, talk down to me like a child who doesn‚Äôt know any better, told me to ‚Äúeducate myself and be better‚Äù, and then said they were leaving the group, effectively killing the entire campaign and ending the group as a whole. I had been aware of some of these issues and was hoping to resolve some of them at the start of the school year, but a lot of these issues I told them about either before they happened or they were entirely made up and based on their thoughts, such as claiming I was implying sexual assault and domination over one of the characters, which had never even occurred to me because I set hard boundaries in my games for that kind of stuff!

1. I‚Äôm a senior, and I‚Äôve spent my entire college life improving myself, physically, mentally, and emotionally so that I can be a better person and grow out of the messed up town I grew up in. I love nothing more than to help others and believe in the best of people, because I want others to think that about me. So essentially being told that all my efforts were pointless was an extreme blow to my self-esteem.
2. I have severe trust issues because of my childhood, and what those 3 women pulled really messed with me. I thought we were friends and I could trust them, but instead they lied about how they felt about the game, lied about how they felt about me, and treated me like all the bullies I dealt with when I was younger. It was a wound to my pride and my belief in myself as a good person. On top of all of that, I‚Äôve recently discovered it might‚Äôve been my entire party that thinks like those women, and were also just hiding the truth from me for reasons I can‚Äôt possibly understand since I told them all at the start of the game to always be honest with me.

Normally I wouldn‚Äôt talk about this stuff, since I don‚Äôt like people worrying about me and other people need more attention than I do, but not only did I have a nightmare about this last night, my anxiety has started to act up in ways I can‚Äôt ignore. There‚Äôs going to be a DM fair at my university tonight where people go to find new games, and there‚Äôs a very likely chance I‚Äôll run into one of them again. I already told my friends about the situation, and those that will be there are going to keep an eye on me, but I‚Äôm ashamed I‚Äôm feeling this way again because I thought I had grown out of it. I didn‚Äôt know the past could still come back and fuck me to this degree. I wish people would stop lying to me and just be honest.

Discord servers like this one are a great place to make a lot of vague acquaintances with people who have similar interests to you. But they're not at all helpful for making actual friends. Which is fine; Discord is a tool with its defined role.
Real friendships very rarely work online. Which sucks, because it's so hard to find the time or desire to go out IRL and just do things, especially when you don't have many IRL friends to do them with. Making new friends is hard.
It's not impossible, though. I struggle with it too, and it still surprises me how people like me manage to accomplish it, but I've seen it happen. It just takes time and effort. (Apparently)
Sorry I can't offer anything more practical than that. But you definitely have my sympathies","",""

In my experience have denial as their defense mechanism for severe issues, preferring to pretend as if the actual problem is not there whene they don't know how to deal with it. It still sucks, even if ot fully intentional.

I'm very sorry that this happened to you, Toaster. The best advice I can give is to maybe try separately talking about the nature of your issues. If the person cares, they should care enough to at least try to understand. Maybe talk about what you've been diagnosed with?

But this problem resulted on me feeling like i'm worth nothing, that i'm not showing anything off for the world or for anyone else, it is very frustrating and i hate that part of me a lot, because it's always me fighting the same stupid fight against my brain telling myself: ""this time i'm going to do it"" and even when i make it it's not enough, it's never enough for me.
 
My parents tried to convince to go to college because they feel like that's the better situation for me, which is: ""get a degree, have a job, live on your own, we are not going to live to support you for the rest of your life so you have to get your shit together"", but even then i don't think college helped me enough at all for this, and you add to the equation with my problem of not focusing a lot with my game dev work that makes it worse. And the only reason i accepted to go this time around was just so i don't end up fighting with parents in the future, but at a certain point that seems is going to be inevitable.

So i'm just posting about this that i'm going to be less active over here on discord in general, and i'm also trying to avoid a lot of other activities that would distract me from my work and studies. I sometimes might appear on JADS but it will be very infrequent. I want to be worth something in this world and i want to prove for others that i'm not lazy and that i do productive work. Maybe i am thinking pretty dumb right now, but i'm just frustrated to myself and i want to be better.","","üëç (1)"

What an easy way to farm reactions-- Ok, that is a bit too cynical, I do appreciate it, its just that my perception of others and the way they show affection has shifted a bit the last few days. I've always had a hard time receiving affection and that's been getting even harder. I wasn‚Äôt going to open up but I wanted to express the things that come *with* cancer. 
In as few words as possible, cancer is the sword above Damocles. Its not really a death sentence but everyone around you feels that it is, you can‚Äôt really shake it off but, at least on its earlier stages, it isn‚Äôt killing you in a noticeable way. You still feel and are healthy and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs the most confusing. My close family has had to share the news around my extensive family and now we are getting calls from people with cracked voices and broken spirits. Its as if they have less hope for the future than we do. Its as if we are the grim reaper reminding them that we all have an end. 
I won‚Äôt pretend I‚Äôm grown now but when I was younger and didn‚Äôt have a grasp of how life would treat me I used to long about basically feeling deep pain. A tragedy that would challenge my purpose and ‚Äòwake me up‚Äô. So imagine what its like to wake up to see that sword hanging, on the edge and there‚Äôs nothing I can do. And funny enough I have ‚Äòwoken up‚Äô but I‚Äôm not motivated. I just figured that I won‚Äôt have rest or a break to heal, time just moves on, it what it is.

Major TW for sexual assault below (if someone feels like I should spoiler it just lmk)

Alright so about a year ago my brother opened up about how for roughly 4 years of his life he was sexually assaulted by a once close neighborhood friend. This person was practically like a 4th brother and a part of our family for most of my life. We let him in our house, he slept over hundreds of times, went on trips with us, and was pretty much a constant in our lives. To find out that through all of this he was mentally manipulating and sexually assaulting my older brother ..well idk how to explain it, anger, sadness, pain, regret, and so much more. Tonight I had a hard conversation with my brother where we talked about boundaries and how sometimes how I express my sexuality can be triggering for him. I am a gay male and my brother is straight/ace so for him sexual conversations can be triggering, and against his will, even more so when they are gay oriented. He of course supports me and would never in a million years do or say anything homophobic, I just hate that there is this rift in our family because of this person who we all thought for the longest time was like family. This is also made me rethink a major moment in life. When I was first beginning to start puberty this very friend who unknown to me at the time was actively sexually assault my brother right under my nose, made sexual advances on me. For me though it was consensual, I was of course gay then so from my perspective I was simply experimenting for the first time with a person who I also thought was simply experimenting. Though through a story my brother once told me that I don't feel comfortable sharing, this person was simply using me as a tool to get back at my brother. Sexual assault, I'm now realizing, affects more than just the people involved, and even though this person most likely regrets their actions it doesn't change the damage they have done my family. 
Sorry for the really downer post, I've just never really told anyone about my encounter with this person as like I said, it was a consensual act between my self and another kid roughly my age. But thanks for reading, much love ‚ù§Ô∏è

I have to imagine that my scattered sleep schedule has something to do with my current mental state, but knowing that doesn't help much. Anyway.

I've been thinking a lot about relationships lately. Obviously I've still got some hangups about how my last one went, and I'm still dealing with that. Hard to get over a first love, especially when you blame yourself for how it went down. But I'm thinking more generally today (or at least, I'd like to). I've probably said this before, but I think I'm terrified of being in a relationship again. In abstract, being in one sounds nice. It's nice to confide in someone else on that level. It's nice to be able to express affection and love on a deeper level. 

I'd be lying if I said two years of a pandemic directly after a breakup hasn't left me more than a little touch-starved. Some nights I'll nestle into the nook of my pillow and it gets the job done. Others I'm left longing for something long gone that would only hurt me if I could have it. It's annoying, and the worst part is that I can't even be sure I actually want it.

Like I said, I think I'm terrified of being in a relationship. Of trusting someone that much. Of devoting so much time to someone else. Of becoming intimate with someone else. Of having someone else place their trust and expectations on me. I feel like I messed up last time, and in a way that you can't just apologize away. Miscommunication is a two-way street, of course, but... you know how it is. Can't exactly have a conversation with the other party, now can I?","",""
"190188039719485440","jelly386","2022-11-03T11:11:10.6100000+00:00","This is gonna be a weird segue, but it's something I've been wanting to put into words for a while, so I think I want to try.

I've gotten really into yuri manga since my breakup. Since before the end of the relationship, even. It's appealing for a lot of reasons, and some of those reasons also cause me to feel conflicted about my enjoyment of it. That's a pretty ambiguous statement, so let's try and break it down.

For one, I perceive myself as male. I identify as nonbinary to some degree, but even then I present exclusively masc. Being online gives me a degree of seperation from my physical self, and that helps me to explore my gender a little bit more freely, but there's still a part of me that considers myself to be fundamentally male. Back to the point. Yuri manga is, quite obviously, about romance between women. I consider myself to be male in some regard, and so when I engage with this media, I can't help but feel a sense of... displacement. A vouyeristic sense that tells me ""this isn't for you."" Like I'm engaging with something that doesn't belong to me. I guess you'd call it a guilty pleasure?

So, I don't feel like I belong when I read yuri manga, and yet... I can't help but feel that might be why I read it. It gives me this sense of longing that can't really be fulfilled, I guess. Or maybe it allows me to see myself in something which I consider myself to be fundamentally seperate from. Maybe if I can see my feelings and needs in a relationship which could never involve me, I might feel a bit better about myself. Maybe its a kind of wish fulfillment. ""I wish I had that, but I know I can't.""","",""

About a year ago I watched the animated film Paprika for my college class. One of the main characters in the story is this fat, inventor guy. His weight is realistic, not abstracted. I tried a couple times here to describe it, but I just felt kind of gross doing so. The point - which may not surprise you - is that I see a lot of myself in him, physically speaking. I know I'm not terribly overweight, but I can't help but feel disgusted with myself on the odd occasion. I have a similarly hard time detailing my own body without feeling gross. It's probably some form of body dysmorphia, but I don't feel comfortable diagnosing it.

I'm rambling. This character ends of being the love interest of the main character in the end of the story. It's a very touching moment, where they acknowledge their feelings for one another. Very tender. 

It felt very wrong to me, and that scared me.

I think, maybe, that I don't see myself as desirable, or maybe that I don't want to. So when I see someone in fiction that I can relate to too much, and they seem to be desired or achieve something that I might want, I draw back. I can't explain it. It's like... I want to be seen in something else, but only from a distance.

So I read yuri manga. Because no matter how much I read stories about young love, about longing, about being terrified that you're not good enough, about being open and carefree with someone despite those fears, I know that I'll always have that degree of seperation via sex. I don't consider myself to be female, so I can always look in that direction for comfort at a distance.

And I'm not sure how to feel about that.","",""

""Oh, I'm longing for that because I wish *I* was a woman so that *I* could be in that relationship."" It'd put a nice little bow on it all, and then maybe I could do something about it.

My father has been working with a lot of people. He's been through so many teams. Team after team after team.
The reality he faces is that no one cares for early done work.
In fact, if a project is funded saaaaaaaaay $1 million over the course of a year for team to do something -> and they finish 6 months early... what do you think happens? Logic dictates ""You've finished the job and it's well done, so here's the rest of the funds"" because that $1 million __is going to that project__. Sadly, that's not real life. Real life is ""what? You did the project in half the time? Well, here's your final paycheck for the rest of half the amount. Bye"" and close door in face. They don't get the money from the rest of that project.

So what does __***everyone***__ do? They just delay. My father literally does all his work -> and literally just waits. He waits for the deadline while attending meetings, talking about progress and whatever -> and finally just submits it. My mother had to work hard to get him to do this btw because he still wants to submit it early because it's finished; that's the type of person he is. 

My dad aside, because he isn't like everyone else -> they delay and delay and delay. Late? By how much? A week? That's early. Yeah, that's early. 

__This is the standard:__
Deadlines and budgets are a joke. The project is going to cost more than the budget and it's going to be finished well past the deadline. 

Your boss and your clients aren't upset with this. In fact, they're happy that the work gets done.","",""

A lot of what you say is sparking some thoughts which ultimately lead me to think, that this is not okay. I think your rant is well justified, and also that Dice just completely misunderstood what you're saying. 
While I agree with sentiment ""you should not be hard on yourself"", that part is plainly obvious and doesn't really help at all. 
The other thing was about the goals, never make  an abstract goal, your tendency to see things negatively will leave you unsatisfied with it, never accomplishing the goal in question. Being happy is a very toxic thing to strive for, when you're unsatisfied with everything in your life. I'd suggest therapy, and trying to find the reason behind your unwillingness to better yourself. Maybe with understanding, there will also be a bit of motivation.

When last I posted, I had a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with a treatment plan including medication. I've been on that medication, dialing in the dosage, and generally adjusting to being on said medication. Things have improved generally; I'm more stable day-over-day and week-over-week, able to actually enjoy things I'm doing, and have more focus on the things I'm doing. There are too many little things to really comment on with regards to general life changes (e.g. getting back into cooking-experiments, etc), so I'll just leave ""how I'm doing"" at that high-level overview.

I still feel like I have more to go, since I feel like I ought to be more eager to do things that are more like ""work"" (e.g. writing for a tabletop game, modding for a game I like, etc). That being said, part of that slowness has been because I feel like I'm more or less uncompressing and actually regaining some amount of life after being both depressed and burnt out from work. So I suppose I'll get to whatever arbitrary place I feel I should be eventually. It's a work in progress, and progress is being made, at least I think so.

I still feel somewhat of a need to express this *somewhere* so this place might be as good as any for that.

I feel bad. Really bad. Every single day it gets worse and worse. For some reason I started to feel like my mental health has gone to shit a long time ago and I just chose to ignore it and now I'm facing the consequences of that. I feel like there's something seriously wrong with me and I can't fix it. Going to a therapist feels pointless, trying to talk about it feels pointless, it's just...  It feels like there's this whole mess of things wrong inside me that I can't untangle, and every single thing is connected to another, which makes it impossible for me to take it step by step.

I just want to feel good again, but instead of working on it, I choose the easy way out and make my mind busy with games and such, which also stopped being fun for me lately. It all just feels pointless, like I'm wasting time, like it all really doesn't matter in the long run. I can't focus on studying, I don't really feel like giving it my all at anything, I don't take care of things I should.

Besides all of that fuckery I have these completely different problems that just add onto that, like hating myself for a loooong time now, not exactly enjoying how I look and constantly thinking about fucking death.

I seriously can't stop thinking about death recently, it's driving me nuts. Everything makes me end up at thinking about death. Old people? They'll soon die. I'm 20! Another year closer to death! What do I strive for? Dunno, I'll end up dead eventually so does it really even matter?

It's like my mind is so hard focused on it I just absolutely can't escape thinking about it.

Don't even fucking get me started on all the little shitty problems regarding my sexuality, how I hate how much my libido controls my actions even leading to me making utterly idiotic decisions.

There's also a problem regarding how I wish I was born a girl and was able to wear cute clothes and just ***be cute*** but guess what, the universe said fuck that. It's not even that I hate being a guy, I just- I can't even exactly explain it because ***I don't understand it***.

so i decide to, years after, for the first time, to finally put everything im working on to a halt. so that i can only focus on ""work"", that is learning to code. what it ends up is
1) i didnt code
2) get a strong desire to do something, so i install killing floor 2 
3) get a strong drive to do something, so i took way more nap than usual. 
that is when i really learn my biggest issue is not the distractions i have, it is not im addicted to games and comics and shows(uninstall discord will not help either had i tried). it is the procrastination and self motivation i severely suffer from.
ppl tell me taking a job, regardless of part time or full time is good. and ppl also say taking a university course for coding is good. i.....dont think those 2 will fix my severe procrastination and self motivation issue had i listened back then. taking a job will distract me from coding further and get increasingly annoyed&stressed. a university course i would end up in the same habit as my previous university course, severe procrastination and barely passes and feel like learning nothing. really, it is hard to know whether things are right for you until you have tried it, past experience are ultimately just data. 

the coming to a halt move has helped me pinpoint what issue i should work on before i can decide what i want to do in life: fighting procrastination. when there is less expectations, weight, stakes, deadlines, scope, difficulty, planning i am much more motivated. that is how i can get my personal project done. back when i go to school, go to university lectures, go to work they are entirely based on extrinsic motivation. that is also how i can get works i dont enjoy done, there is expectations set in by someone else even if i despise them.","",""

if by 2023 i still have not started coding, i will just find a job, ANY job, to just give myself a wage, to actually have an outside life, and to gain experience.

Think about why you procrastinate. Really understanding why you procrastinate can give you a clearer idea on how to approach the problem. I often procrastinate because I'm overwhelmed at how much work there is to do, so what usually helps me is setting concrete goals, and making extremely detailed to-do lists for these so I don't have to think about the task as much. Like, rather than ""start learning to code"", which is rather vague, something concrete like ""do a lesson on language on website"" and the steps you need to take to do it like ""open your computer, type in website name"" etc to break down the task to more manageable steps. Then set a timer to like 5 mins and try to just stay on the task for that period. Usually starting is the hardest, and once you've started it becomes easier to work past the 5 mins. I also learned of another method, which helped others I know, tho explaining it here might be much, so you can dm me if you want to know more lol

Also setting small, realistic goals really helps. If you have not been doing **anything** recently, even just finishing one 5 min lesson is an achievement! 
I haven't completely fixed my procrastination, but I have improved quite a bit by using these methods in particular, so I hope they can help :)","",""

I thought it would be possible to somehow ""fix"" them, or at least make it easier for them. I recognize now that this way of thinking about autistic people is very very dangerous and hurtful

I have since apologized to them, but despite that I still feel bad for ignoring their nature and just trying to 'do' the relationship despite the fact they had trouble with how it was going

In the end ending the relationship was a mutual decision, which we both found necessary
I genuinely hope and want to believe they feel better now

Started out with me clearly drawing a line in the sand at something and then 2 days in a row them impulsively (not deliberately) breaking that boundary, and then the last 3 months has been a cycle of trying to communicate/negotiate what I'm comfortable with, and then eventually them forgetting and breaching it

They're not doing it maliciously (I would be far, *far* away from them if they were) but it's been fucking with my mental health for a while now. Recently, literally right after walking a date to the station they did something which I very explicitly had told them in the past not to do, and now I've spent the last 2-3 days on and off having panic attacks, bursting into tears, etc

I've spent a long long time trying to get something consistent between us when it comes to physical touch but at this point I'm realising that they might actually just not be able to fulfil their side of things no matter how many times I try to communicate

So right now I'm pretty certain this is headed towards a breakup. Even outside of this issue, the rest of our relationship has been affected negatively by this to the point that I'm not sure what there even is to save. They're finally emailing a therapist but I'm not sure if I can afford to hang around and hope they get better

These past two days it's been me just waking up going to work going to sleep and waking up, which is a normal for me, but I'm so exhausted from everything:
- My job, all the work, and stress that comes with it. 
- biting my tongue all day long dealing with hostile customers and toxic work
- my knee which fucking hurts and yet I need to walk for 13h daily. 
- me not being able to put in the work into actually changing this.
- feeling of inadequacy, incompetency
- my awful memory
- no real social life during most weeks.
- these thoughts, that urge me to quit, do dumb things, instead of getting better.

I've also completely neglected excercise, I need to excercise daily for medical reasons, but I haven't done so in months.
I can't focus, move on, get my life together. 

At work they keep bugging me about me underperforming, and it combines with all the toxic things to just make me feel a insecure about my intelligence. 
I don't believe I can even attend the uni I was thinking about attending. I feel too dumb, distracted, self sabotaging to actually make it. 
And I lack human contact, not romantic, just real friends, who I do have, but won't ever reach out to. 

My mom is still destroying her health. I am still unable to live like an adult.
If I was living alone, I'd probably faint from starvation or something. I'm just too lazy.

Waking up in 6h. Need to end this somehow. I want to cry, give up. I won't but like it's so much pain. I have to end this monologue somehow...

Basically, I'm scared that I'm slipping into old habits. I mentioned previously that my ex is in the server for the Wandersong Zine, yeah? Well.
How can I put this?
I'm feeling that gnawing desire for her attention and approval clawing its way back into me. Like my body desperately wants to engage in conversation. Talk about the same topics. Make jokes. Share thoughts and memes. That sorta thing. Just any kind of interaction. I'm remembering why it was that I was so attracted to her, in the social sense. Similar humor, similar tastes, similar conversational tone, that sorta thing.
And I'm feeling torn as a result. I'm of three minds about the whole situation, and my thoughts are this:
- I want to be stronger than this feeling. It's been two and a half years now, and I should be able to recognize that I don't need that attention in my life anymore. I'm disgusted that I feel that pull, and I'm scared that running from it means I might never get over it.
- I desperately want to interact with others in the community and those involved in this project. These are very much *my people,* and this is a good opportunity for me to make friends, connections, or even just chat with like-minded folks.
- I want to stay involved with this project, plain and simple. I've resolved to stay involved if I can, and I want to follow through on that. I want a long-term goal for myself that allows me to challenge myself and gain confidence in my abilities.","","ghosthug (4)"

As far as correspondence for the Zine, updates and check-ins via email and social media are both viable and expected options. Being in the discord isn't necessary by any means, and my participation would be no less legitimate if I wasn't there. This does, however, conflict with some of my wants. If I'm not in the discord, I can't interact as readily with the people I'd like to get closer to. As it stands, I still can't really do that if my ex is involved in the conversations. Leaving the discord also conflicts with the first want, as... I dunno, I guess it would feel like running away. I've resolved to do this thing, and I hate the idea that fear of *interacting with someone* would keep me from enjoying this to its fullest. I feel like doing the whole thing via email correspondence would make it feel like an assignment rather than a community effort, so to speak.

It's... annoying. I want to stay, but I feel like staying is potentially harmful. I want to leave, but I feel like leaving is sacrificing more than I would gain. I just wish I wasn't still so... *vulnerable.* I wish the pain and fear weren't still so fresh. I wish my chest didn't still get tight just seeing something related to her. I feel stuck, and I'm annoyed because I know that I'm stuck and I don't want to be. I just don't know how to get unstuck.
I'm rambling more than a bit. Just something I needed to get out, I guess. Feeling a little better now that I have, but advice (or conversation in general) would be appreciated. Don't worry too much, though. I'll be fine one way or another.","","ghosthug (11)"

You're absolutely right in saying that I've been getting better. I remember back when the breakup first happened, and... *wow* that was bad. One time I had to go home from work early because I saw her family at the restaurant and had a full blown panic attack when I got back to the kitchen.

I'm probably gonna be too rambly since I‚Äôve actually tried writing this message, write to others, about myself and other stuff for like two months now. I just haven‚Äôt been able to construct proper sentences so apologies beforehand.
I wanted to give you my two cents about the emotional side of things more so than how you can handle the situation at hand. All I have to say about it is, even **if** you decide to leave the server and interact with members exclusively outside of it‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not running away. I get how very annoying it can be for you to step back due to your own emotions but this is not a matter of staying in your comfort zone, this is a matter of your emotions trying to protect you which does have a difference.
So, back when my ex and I parted ways I had to handle existing in the same close friend group as them and I felt like I was slowly asphyxiating. What I did then was draw a line in the sand, I told my friends I wasn‚Äôt gonna be in any call with them and if they were to join a call, I‚Äôd leave. For a while that worked and at least for a short period I was able to live peacefully. 
Healing is just a big, sometimes stupidly slow process. No matter how long it takes, it lasts for as long as it has to last. As Raye commented, this can take a while. I know it all too well, so I hope you can get out soon enough. Hope you can enjoy the zine as much as possible.","","‚òùÔ∏è (2)"

the other day i messaged him asking him how he was doing and out of nowhere he said ""im sorry, i dont know if you'll block me and never want to see me again but i have to get this off of my chest, i've been trapped in this web of lies for too long""
which is a hell of a opening for a message
he told me he started messaging me (about 1.5 months ago) when he was still with his now ex bf because he wanted attention and he rarely gave it to him
they got back together a week ago and then broke up definitely a few days later when he found out about his tinder account
i asked him if he was ready for a new relationship and he said that currently he isn't
i told him that i was also worried that he might do the same thing with me, to which he responded that if his ex treated him like i did then he wouldn't have tried to cheat on him, which is something i guess
so i ended up telling him that i was glad he was honest with me, that it was really important for me, and that i wouldn't mind meeting up with him as long as he didn't have any other dude in his head
he told me it was gonna take a while and that we could see each other as friends for now, and see if we fall in love with each other

Feeling lonely in a relationship is awful but admitting they feel they ""need"" the attention does come across as an unhealthy outlook (after all, as others have commented on before here a relationship should be complementary to your life, not essential).

I‚Äôve been meaning to do this for around a month or something but honestly I just haven‚Äôt found a way to express myself. I have been very scatterbrained to the point I feel like I‚Äôm not even awake/conscious most of the time and I hate this. What annoys me the most is that I have been doing well, things have looked up but this damn brain fog doesn‚Äôt allow me to enjoy it or even talk about it. I have been healing but God its so hard to focus on anything right now. I know I don‚Äôt have to tell the good folks from a Discord server how I‚Äôm doing but I strongly feel the need to write this, for myself.
So. Where I‚Äôve been. After therapy I‚Äôm in a better spot but I‚Äôm not good. This is a rare moment for me since I have the capabilities and tools to improve but I lack the motivation which remains my biggest issue. However, thanks to therapy, my mindset has shifted quite a bit. So even after getting shit news like my dad getting cancer and me not making the cut for the college career I wanted to swap to I was resilient enough to keep moving forward after that. And look, that sounds pretty bad but things haven‚Äôt been as bad as they seem. My dad has had cancer for **10 years** ||dontmakeayakuzajokedontmakeayakuzajokedontmakeayakuzajokedontmakeayakuzajoke|| which obviously tore my insides apart when I first heard it but in reality his cancer is fairly small and hasn‚Äôt spread so the solution is simple and short, it will be done very soon. As for my studies, its actually harder to look for optimism there. For as many ways I try to see it I did straight up waste 3 years of my life academically. I haven‚Äôt been a functional student in a lot more time but at least it wasn‚Äôt this bad all the time. And now, the one door I thought I did want to go through is closed. In its place a lot more other doors have opened but now my issue is, what do I want to do with my life. I hate having such ambiguous ambitions that don‚Äôt give me enough clarity on what path to take. Its not often I envy people but man having specific and set life goals sounds pretty cool. One of the things I‚Äôve been told that has hurt me the most was getting rejected for someone that felt I just didn‚Äôt dream enough. I don‚Äôt lack drive, I just don‚Äôt have a proper direction to go to so I guess I‚Äôll have to see what I do in this new chapter of college. 
So. What happens now? I‚Äôve borrowed my friends‚Äô dads‚Äô keyboard so I can practice something during the holidays. I still have hope for my drawing abilities but I hate my current setup so maybe that will start later. I‚Äôve getting into photography again, I‚Äôve taken a variety of dumb pictures to keep me sane for this past sick days, editing has also been pretty fun. But yeah‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs so much stuff I feel like I left out lol but this is the best I can do for now. I'll post a pic I liked from a few days ago.

Maybe it's worth telling your friends that? If f they were aware of how you preferred to socialize, I'm sure they'll find ways to work with that. If they care about you enough to message you, they'll take time to learn how you like operate. üíö 

As for the ""feeling like a dickhead"" part, it's probably way more pronounced in your mind than you think.. Most places are more tolerant of blunt attitude than you think ( I'm kind of assuming this is what you're talking about ) And if you were assholeish, people would be sure to let you know. 
And I feel even in those cases basic conflict resolution still works, just a simple explaining the intention of your comments, some excusing for making them feel that way, people can become much more open to misunderstandings. 
Then again, I doubt you really come off that way. People can be their own worst critics. üíö Come drop by, at random, in any conversation that interests you, and don't feel shy about disappearing as soon as you stop caring.

Food- Roughly 1744 calories per day according to body weight + height. Keep weight consistent.
Water- Two cups of water once a hour, set a timer.

During the day: Use work as a distraction, Every 1 hour, 15 minute stretch. After three hours, automatic break of 30 minutes. During these 30 minutes, open book and start studying for that 'break' period. Repeat. 

Extras:
- Don't listen or watch anything you like because you'll associate it with the current issues later down the line.
- Listen to breakcore, not my cup of tea but it's the only thing that stops my brain from wandering. 
- When time to sleep, just listen to some study-podcast to keep the mind occupied.

I set aside a specific time in my schedule for just watching something with friends, but minus that I need to keep my mind constantly occupied. If I don't, I start thinking about the issue and that can get bad ugly. I'm not trying to find a solution, I'm just not in a good place mentally to do that. So I just need to survive.

Currently i dont have anyone to talk about what's in my mind, in fact i just broke contact with a close friend (i managed to compose myself enough to make it in good terms, im a bit proud of that). Thing is im currently going thru a severe spike on depression, making me a bit jumpy or unstable. It started when i talked with this friend about some sexual harassment problems (him towards me) that i kept under the rug cuz i want able to process. From there to now he preferred to cut all contact between us, since having me there was messing up with his life and other relationships.

I dont know how to feel. I'm...afraid. I'm pursuing a career in cardiothoracic surgery and now...I am schizophrenic. I feel like everything's being uprooted. Everything I've tried so hard to keep together for so fucking long.

The crippling fear I have is progression. Right now, I experience horrifyingly vivid visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations alongside the standard negative symptoms like anhedonia, blunted affect, alogia, catatonia, etc.

The complication with the diagnosis came from my seeming lack of delusional thought. I have phases of heightened paranoia and anxiety, but not to the level of constituting delusion.

I'm terrified that as time passes, I will eventually be full on diagnosed with schizophrenia. That I will be full on dealing with delusional thought. That I wont be able to pursue my life's passion in the medical field because of my illness. 

I have given up so much just to chase this one dream and it feels fucking awful to feel it slipping away from me. That too because of my own fucking head. 

When it hits, I feel so repulsed. Like my own brain is violating me. I cant walk around corners or sleep in a closed room alone. I can't open boxes or cabinets because I'm terrified of what's in them. I cant sleep at night with a blanket over me because that sensation morphs into the feeling of dozens of hands rubbing all over me, grabbing at me.

I dont even know what the point of this post is. I'm just venting out months of frustration at this point.  I'm sorry.","","ghosthug (11)"

No good dehydrated, just two shots hit me REALLY hard and it was‚Ä¶ awesome. I felt so much better. I just chatted with my roommate for the morning and it was great. I felt so positive and free and just like I was fucking living.

And I‚Äôm scared of it. My family had a lot alcohol dependence provlems, I know I‚Äôm an addictive personality, fucking abused by my best friends after all, I‚Äôm on antidepressants, so many reasons to ONLY be very intentional with my use, if any. 

But it felt so good and like, every time I‚Äôve been that drunk I‚Äôve been good. This nice relaxed kind and really excited individual. I live life better when tipsy to near drunk, even if it‚Äôs only happened a single digit number of times.

I do feel a bit shit to bring this up as the context is wildly different than my own experience, but hopefully I can make some sense to you all (Spoilers of course for the following):
||""I never thought it would feel this painful to be so different from everyone else. Maybe there will be hope for me when I get older. But I can't take it anymore. If only 19 years is this bad, then there's no way I'll ever be able to take a couple more decades.""||

So this next year I will turn 30, which has left me feeling increasingly anxious as it has been getting closer over the last few years.

I made the mistake of signing up for a bootcamp course in programming. But it seems that the only (good and structured) alternative was to back to uni for a full CS degree?

I could talk to the few I have friends, but... I don't want to bother them anymore with my stuff, as I feel I'm always crying to them.  

I've started this year getting my heart broken, I confessed to my best friend of 6 years, and, well... It didn't go well. I feel so alone and with no motivation to do anything, I didn't realize how much pain I would feel after confessing to them, I thought I was strong enough to bear it but... damn, It hurts, so so much. 

They were one of the few people I could talk about anything I wanted, hell, they were my best friend, and I'm so afraid to lose them forever, I'm afraid I will never be able to stop loving them. 

And to top it all of, I'm failing college. I did so horrible last semester and I burned all of my chances to keep studying. In a few days I have an important exam, that will be the last chance to keep me in school, if I fail I will be kicked out and my life will probably be over. I still have a few days to study but... I just don't have the motivation to do anything....

it's nice at first, but when the feeling wears off I'm left with only my own thoughts. I can't make myself do stuff most of the time, because I am genuinely insecure, and when I have the time, I feel overwhelmed by the opportunity/loneliness. 
I'm not feeling the worst, but it's eating away at me. My interaction with my family is minimal, and I just feel like I don't even exist in their lives, when I don't share the same space with them. 
I've been trying to do some stuff today, to no success alas, since I get overwhelmed by everything super fast. For example, I've been cooking a basic stock soup, and I've been stressing over it for like 4h until it was done, and then I was still stressing over it for quite some time, for some reason.
I've been trying to send out Uni application, but the system is confusing, and my brain shut down. I suspect this is probably executive disfunction. Almost all tasks I don't do routinely are so daunting, and when alone, it makes me feel powerless. 
I can't imagine, how am I going to survive on my own. I've gone for days with eating plain food, or not eating at all in the past, because even eating is too much work sometimes.

on a plus side, I got myself *completely legal copies* of books I need for my uni entrance exams (the books aren't even available in shops<:Valle:458329445741101056> ).

I'm an introverted guy, but I'd never lived alone before that. The scary part was that I'm staying in CA while she moved back to our home state in the south east. 
     We've only lived in this area since ~6 months before the pandemic, so I don't exactly have a large pool of friends. Surprisingly, this would not be the main problem I would eventually face. I found a state of peace in the solitude of my first six months alone, as well as a new-found motivation and success with fitness. 
     A couple weeks ago, my ex and I mutually decided we were ready to date again. Don't worry - I promise this isn't another story of male insecurity about her seeing other people. We had been together for so long that a paradigm shift occurred in the dating space: apps. I was optimistic and positive-minded at first, as I work alone and still don't know many people. 
     It's not hard for me to understand why I've heard nothing but negativity about these apps. They have been an absolute pox on my mental health, but I hope I can learn to use them in a healthier way. Is that even possible when you can just swipe forever looking for the next one or comparing yourself to others?
     TLDR: I've spent time with more people in the past couple weeks than I did in the previous six months combined; despite that, I've never felt more lonely.","","ghosthug (1)"

i just cant make sense of it. i wish i had a clear goal to work towards, internally or externally. i mean externally i suppose i am working towards a goal, since i'm in university. but it doesn't feel like it. feels like i'm a backseat passenger in the car ride that is my life. and maybe the worst thing about that is that i don't know if i'd want to have it any other way. listlessness has devoured me. 

i'm confused. perpetually. and overwhelmed. if there's one feeling that has defined my life, it's being overwhelmed. i'm just not cut out for this world. everything is too much to take in. i dont wanna think about any of it. i don't wanna be. 

it's frustrating going on an embarassingly solipstic spiel like this without even arriving at any coherent point about myself, my life, the world. but i also feel like it'd be more self-serving if anything to flagellate myself over it so i'm gonna try not to do that either. venting is the whole point of this channel anyway, right?

Revel in the imperfections, it‚Äôs those things that make things human, a machine never makes a mistake, but it also never learns. So yeah, just keep trying, I know you can do it.","","ghosthug (2)"

Do you know the fear of monster lying under bed? The general paranoia associated with it?

So... I tend to get paranoid intrusive thoughts from time to time. It's not rational, and I don't treat it as such, but it is weird when I stop and think about it. 
The paranoia and associated momentary intrusive thoughts amplify in a feedback loop. The more paranoid I am, the worse the thoughts get. 
Few times, I've started misappropriating sensory information. Like a sound effect in a game reminded me of my mom angrily calling me, and I automatically wanted to respond, and looked over, even though I know it's fake.

I wonder if it's something trauma related, or maybe associated with psychosis, or something. 

I have a fear of the dark, and sometimes imagine being mugged or killed on the streets, so vividly, it makes me almost panic. 
I know it's fake, but I visually imagine a person behind me stabbing me or something. 
This is not normal, and quite frankly, I've only mentioned it to a couple of friends in passing. Should I be worried?","","ghosthug (6)"

Well I guess I should provide a follow-up: About a month or so ago, after thinking about it some more, I realised that I don't care. I think I had been led to believe that I'm supposed to be like everyone else and I should be making loads of new friends because I'm at university and that's what you're supposed to do. But I realised that I don't have to do that if I don't want to, because I just really don't like doing that. I prefer being with my small number of friends that I already have that I know really well. I know it sounds obvious when I put it like that, but it really was forced on me from all directions that I should be making loads of new friends at this time in my life. And then when I saw other people who seem just like me being good at socialising, it made me jealous of them. So I'm trying not to be jealous of them anymore because it's not something I aspire to do anymore.

But the level of vitriol and hatred hurdled towards me was too much to bare. I feel so shit. I had to leave work early because I've been throwing up all day. It was so hard to hear a person I loved have so much hatred for me. I know it will be fine one day and I've completely gotten off SM and stuff apart from this, but man do I feel like shit... 

Just to be clear here though, this isn't about cheating or anything. It was about the attitude which we held after the breakup.","","ghosthug (14)"

I hate, how she doesn't care, can't admit she has a problem. She's drunk almost every evening, which makes conversing with her especially challenging. Add to that here chain-smoking, god damnit, she's killing herself. 
Every time we mention it she gets defensive, and feels attacked. Clearly she's unwell, but I've spoken about this in way more detail in the past. 
The thing that gets me is not only the fact she's harming herself, but also everyone around. 
My little sister hasn't had significant support from parents since she was like 7. They've hung out with their friends in bars, and cafe's instead. 
Not to make it sound totally terrible, we were mid to late teens by then, it's normal for parents to want some alone time, but this is too much. I've never wanted to call them out, since I've understood they're tired, but looking back it's obvious this wasn't normal, and certainly not the epitome of good parenting. 

*Tangent*
I don't want to sound ungrateful, they did much, and the last 12 years were nothing but tragedy after tragedy for them. I still feel mom should do more, though at this point it's pretty obvious, that she's at her breaking point. She's had severe PTSD symptoms ever since her father died, and when her husband (dad) died, it completely crushed her. She's not able to lead the household. Frankly, I'm so worried how she herself is going to recover. 

Back to the topic at hand‚Ä¶
My little sister is having a really tough time. She is getting to the age when she needs to pick a high school, really learn how to learn, and similar important young teen things, and it seems like she's all alone.
My mom doesn't see, that my sister needs care and support, and it's really getting to me.

Idk what to do at this point. 
I don't want to assume responsibility for my sister, since no one at home respects me, and it always turns at badly. Also, I wouldn't be able to handle it.","","ghosthug (5)"

Unfortunately, this was also when my gf (hopefully just ex gf and not late ex gf) started telling me about her situation. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to drive their (the car I used back in hs) car for any purpose; so I was stuck at home, which I often spent attempting to calm myself via smoking.

<@194268453274648584> Hello, I am sorry to hear about what you are going through. I think personally in this case, you should reevaluate your priorities and think in a more personally sustainable way. Psychologically people have a bad habit of piling on issues until everything becomes impossible to deal with. For example, I would suffer from this for classes I am in, I would make my classwork and list of things I need to do bigger and bigger and bigger until I had a list no one could ever do. That's dumb, its unhealthy, and it never helped me. I realized as I did more and more that the only way to get things done is to break up tasks into smaller and smaller tasks. Instead of thinking of my classes as one big list of chores that I could never finish, I broke it up into single classes, and then broke up those classes into sub tasks. When I did that I slowly brought down the issue one by one. For you, I would suggest making your first course of action making your brain work in that way. If you can wire your brain to divide and conquer tasks, you can do them far better. Once you can start to do that, I would try and see what I could do for basic living. You said you have no job, and no vehicle. You can't drive but that's okay, you could try and learn how to drive a vehicle, or all else fails, use public transport. Once you can sort that out, you can start looking for a job, or a way to make a steady income. If you have no job, you should not be too picky, you have to start somewhere, any job is a good job for the person who needs money. I would try to then work towards getting a job, so that I can start bringing in any kind of income. After you can get that situated, you can work towards other issues. If you cannot financially sustain yourself, you cannot help yourself or do anything good. I know this seems a bit obvious or a bit oblivious, but I think it is sincerely good advice for someone in a situation you appear to be in. If you need to talk more about what's going on, feel free to hit me up. I am always available to talk. I hope for the best for you!

A lot of it is social stigma, a lot of it is underfunded mental healthcare, a lot of it is lack of awareness of mental illness. A lot of people on the autism spectrum for example learn how to blend in well if their autism is not spotted early. Its not that they have a unique form of autism or anything, its just that like all other people, they learn to adapt. If you feel like you might have some kind of illness, or someone you know might have some kind of illness, the best way to learn if its true or not is to go to a professional, and get tested. Other then that, there's not some magic bullet that can be used to 100% diagnose mental disorders. If you want to talk more about it, feel free to ask, I can try and give as best information as I can. Best of luck to you!

I cannot do anything else for you I'm sorry. I can however can offer advice with high school. I do not know a lot about your situation but I do believe you can complete high school, I am sure you are a smart and strong person.

No matter what, even through hell you cannot stop. I hope things get better, I really honestly do. I hope you can find everyone safe and well. I hope you can use your artistry to support yourself. I hope you can find a living that is good for you. If you need someone to talk to, vent, I am always here to listen. In times that are harsh, I turn to prayer, I hope you have something you can turn to in dark times, be that someone, or something you find solace in. I pray things get better for you.

<@73494335387082752> Hello, I am real sorry to hear about these delusions you are suffering with. I do not know what to say that could help you other then to contact a medical professional and to possibly take medications if that helps. I do not know what else could in the long term solve your issue. I know you do not want to be admitted/sectioned, but if you are feeling delusions so strongly and often as you say you are, the only safe and healthy way to improve is through a doctor, or healthcare. Society does not demand the sick heal themselves, they go to a doctor to help them. I hope that its better now though and I hope you feel better and get better. If you need to talk about anything feel free to ask. I am not a professional, but I do work in a hospital so maybe I might have some kind of information that might be relevant? Regardless, I am sorry to hear you are dealing with these delusions.

I have been there before, dying in a public space feeling like everyone is watching me and mocking me. Its taken a lot of self actualization to realize that's not true. But really it is not true y'know? I mean, think of the last time you remember someone in a grocery store, just a stranger, when was the last time you really cared about what someone else was doing in a grocery store? I assume its likely that you cannot easily think about it, or have to think back to some kind of outrageous incident to have some kind of core memory. People are self centered. They care about themselves. It can be a bad thing, but on the upside, it means that almost all of the time, they do not care what's going on with you, or what you look like. Especially in places like grocery stores, people are interested in buying food and then going home. No one goes to a grocery store for any other reason. It will be okay I promise, you just have to embrace that fact that others are in their own world. In the worst case scenario, where this is not possible, maybe you could look into alternative ways to get groceries. I know in my state, you can order groceries online and then just have them delivered to the front door, or left ready for pickup as soon as I arrive. Maybe they have something similar for you? I would look into that if this issue is severe enough for you! If you want to talk or have anything to get off your mind, feel free to hit me up. Otherwise I hope you feel better this issue.

<@188224129122435072> I am sorry to hear about all this, I know you've been going through a lot, and I know we've talked about it a lot. It sucks to see these issues reemerge despite the time and effort put in to make them go away. Life is so draining and hard, difficult and stupid, but you have got to just keep trying at it. Keep doing what you can do, keep trying your best. If you don't keep moving forward and trying to do what you can, then you will led astray. I cannot offer much advice, I don't know what I would do in your scenario, but I do hope that things get better. I can offer you moral support. I am really sorry to hear about the verbal abuse and mental issues you are dealing with. I hope things get brighter. Find what works for you, and just keep doing it. Find a professional that works for you if that helps. If you feel you are in such a rut, a professional can offer a lot more assistance then I or others here can. If you need to talk I can always offer my voice and mind however. I hope things get better for you though, I really do.

In order to stream you need to have a pretty good internet connection, which is just not possible for some people. Also streaming is a big time investment (and money investment) and small streamers make basically no money. So I think that like Mimi said you should consider reevaluating your priorities. You can just start with trying to get some basic things done. If you think that you are ""useless IRL"" then you should try to make yourself better. I know that's not as easy as it sounds, but I think that streaming is just not the solution to your problems. Again really hope you can get through this.

I'm not sure if I can do what you do and just not care what other people think. Guess that when it comes down to it I'm struggling a bit with wanting there to be some underlying objectivity in games, movies, books, music etc., that determines their quality (not withstanding genres and such). And at the same time thinking such pieces of media are inherently subjective, cause people come to it with vastly different experiences, expectations, and might value parts of it very differently. Which means that even if you could reach 100% consensus on parts of the media, determining an objective quality is still near impossible. 
I also guess that a not so small parts of why I feel the way I feel is because I want my thoughts and opinions validated (even if I might be wrong), I guess that's only human <:jphNyeh:814618628073979966>

Just because of where we are born or what happens to us outside of our control, our whole lives can be made extremely difficult. That is not something to be minimized. I am very, very sorry for you.

Look, when I was just getting out of school, I was very anxious about what I was going to do with my life. I, like you, hated school. I procrastinated all of my assignments, just spent all my time gaming or being online. I didn't learn any skills, I didn't do anything physical, and I realized that college was not in the cards for my future, and neither was staying at home. So I had to very quickly come to grips with needing to find work so that I could survive.

I don't live in Venezuela, I can't give you tips for finding work there. Maybe V-tubing is actually your best bet financially; I can't say for certain. But I *can* give you a tip for life in general as a poor person: you need to be willing to take on any kind of work, no matter how uncomfortable it is or how unqualified you feel. You say that you are unable to get a job IRL, and that is true of many people, so I won't argue that you aren't trying hard enough or being too picky or anything like that. But again, you must be willing to do *anything*. The *first* thing you find that you are physically able to do, you must seriously consider that you may *need* to do *that.*

I ended up becoming a service worker; I take care of elderly and infirm people. It was the first job I was able to qualify for. It pays very poorly, and many of the people I work for are very harsh toward me. But, getting more experienced has made the job easier and has given me a measure of stability. Service jobs, especially in poor areas, will not be going away anytime soon. Maybe that applies to where you live, too.

Again, the system we live in is unfair. I feel extremely bad for you, and I don't like giving the advice that I am. But this is what has been proven true for me.","",""
"701528112625614858","freesimples","2023-02-07T03:02:36.2780000+00:00","Also, I should say that while you can always talk here and vent, we in Jads can only do so much, and our advice is very limited. You say that you have no people skills, and that may be true, but you can still reach out to someone in your area and ask them for their advice. If you have no one that you know that are willing to help you, then try talking to strangers. Businesses, people on the street, whomever. Perhaps you know someone online who would know more about the options you have where you live. People can be surprisingly kind and helpful if you give them the chance. V-tubing may work out for you, and I hope it does, but if it does not, you need to reach out.

I'm sorry for being so direct. I don't want to scare you, but I also don't want to be dishonest and promise that everything will be just fine.

If you take anything from this, take this: 
Do not give up on yourself and your ability as a human being to take the situation that you are in and do everything you can to make the most of it. Do not tell yourself that you are unable to do one thing or another. Always continue to try.

Sometimes the reality of our situation is that we just have to take the hand that we have been dealt and make the most of it. Again, I hope V-tubing can work out for you. It just seems like a risky investment.

You can always talk here on jads. Just keep in mind that here in the mental health channel the best we can usually offer to people is emotional support. Especially for such a niche situation, you're probably better off looking somewhere else for more practical advice. As for finding work where you live, few people are going to be able to have better advice than the people who are also where you live. If working with your family isn't going to work for you, then try reaching out.

But yeah, don't give up on your own ability to better yourself or to change your situation. Just because you aren't able to do some forms of work now doesn't necessarily mean it has to stay that way. Keep that in mind, just in case","",""

Its my belief that regardless of one's privilege or struggles what we face alone can only be defined by ourselves. From what I can tell your problems are very much justified and I don't think I'm saying anything you haven't heard before but don't compare your struggle with others. Can you measure them? Sure, maybe, but that's irrelevant. What falls under your shoulders is what you should focus on above all else. 

I really hope there are ways in which you can extrapolate an answer that will put your mind to rest so you can come back better than before but in the meantime, know that your problems are as important as everyone else's, because they are yours and you matter. Hope everything gets better soon.","",""

Be it this or one of the many communities for trans folks online I think you should reach out and speak your mind because for as much evil shit that I will not deny, does exist, there are enough people who care. As for therapy, I cannot assure of anything, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but recently I have heard of friends from where I live that do get therapy that does focus on queerness but that's just around me.

To answer your questions
I do have access to a bicycle but they're not mine, and the people that own them, my mom and her boyfriend are in a worst situation than me, their only car  needed some repairs, they dont exactly have lot of money so dont know when they are able to repair the car, they do lots of errands and they need every vehicle they can get, they need it more than me
I dont know what yummy is, i dont live in america
No, i do not exercise
Not a single person in my area can help my situation, because everybody has same problem or worse than me, or they are bad people, like scammers
No i do not go in facebook because the same reasons, my country has lots of scammers or bad people or people struggling trying to make a living and trying to get money to escape the country or anything else
The problem is that im not an athletic person or i barely talk to anyone besides my family, and my country is asking for a really charismatic person or an athletic person, and the vtubing thing i dont really know what you are talking about, if someone talked about me and didnt mention me then i probably did miss it, sorry, but i got all the equipment necessary to stream, except a second monitor because its really hard to do this with only one screen, and by getting out of my comfort zone i think streaming its one of them, no? I need to be a charismatic person, which i am not, a funny person that can make people laugh, which i am not, or sing or drawing or do anything like that, which i am not one of those things, i am  basically a empty shell that doesnt know how to do anything but i can learn anything with enough help and motivation","",""

I always feel obligated to help people. Not just the bare minimum, but above and beyond. I read/hear/listen about a lot of other people's problems and decide, yep, I'm going to step in! I'm going to be a hero! When in reality I always find myself in a circle of people who use me, or I just go nowhere with them. Or they reject my help, and expect me to fix their lives for them.

It's not like this is, like, ruining my life or anything. It's an inconvenience sure, a waste of time absolutely, and a massive headache is practically guaranteed. But I don't want to fall into the inverse, where I'm apathetic towards everyone's plights, and scorch my heart just so nobody else could do it themselves.

Maybe it's the fact that I've pursued a career in social work? Maybe it's because of my upbringing? I have a lot of theories for why - some I'm already going over with my therapist - but I just want to ask: **Does anyone else feel like this?** Do I make any sense? Hopefully I wasn't too vague. Does anyone else just *feel* other people's misery too hard that they want to help stop the misery only so that it isn't emanating from them anymore?

All I want is to lay my cards on the table and maybe have someone recognize what I'm going through in either themselves or someone they know.

In the past five years or so I have been (but not always felt) very mentally unstable. I greatly struggle with my sense of self and feel disconnected from the world, to the point where having a normal conversation is a struggle because its like no one is at the wheel. I lose all of my ambitions completely, be they creative, social or romantic, and doing anything but fulfilling my basic needs becomes a straining, conscious effort. Sometimes I feel ready to burst out crying, or to have an anxiety attack for seemingly no reason, but never quite get there because there simply isn't that amount of emotion in me. But then something changes. Usually because of some external factor (be it a new therapist, counsellor or any such initiative) I become convinced I finally found ""my cure,"" and suddenly my life is back on track. I become happier and more talkative, start working out again, and put in at least a little effort trying to socialize. Now my mind is working on overdrive, daydreaming most of my waking hours about all of the amazing stuff I want to do with my life, while simultaneously beating myself up for getting none of it done. I'll find myself suddenly experiencing euphoria doing nothing but fantasizing, sometimes multiple times a day, with no external trigger whatsoever. Eventually, however, it inevitably crashes and I go back to feeling like my conception of reality is being warped. Incidentally, that's roughly where I'm at at the time of writing this.","",""

<@1077664861045145651> Hey I read what you wrote. You are heard, don't worry. What you are describing sounds a lot like having a bipolar type disorder, I know people with BPD and they don't describe the exact same thing, but they describe similar types of things where they have ""waves"" of euphoria and glee and then waves of depression where they don't feel like doing anything. I am obviously not a professional, and I am obviously not speaking from a place of authority but based on just what you've told me and my personal experience, that's what might fit the bill best. I'm glad that you are with a mental health professional to determine that medically and I hope that they can help you. Regardless of all that, I think what might be useful is grounding strategies.  They tend to work best for panic attacks, but they might help you in this case to keep yourself grounded and more tethered with reality. For example when I am really feeling something bad, I try and just step out of my head as best I can and tether, focus on how many doors are in the room, what colors are the walls, what the time is, what the day is, what I ate today, inane information like that tends to help my brain reboot. I hope that you can get better and feel better I hope I was helpful in any way. If you need to talk more, I'm always available.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<@188224129122435072> I don't think you're incompetent, I think you're just really effective at minimizing yourself. I know we've talked extensively about how its going for you, and I understand all the strife you have going on. It appears to me that the biggest issue is that you are too harsh on yourself and too reluctant to build that positive self voice. I know you can do it, I know you're a smart, nice, and capable individual, but I think it might be that you get lost on proving that to yourself. Sometimes in life you make a little mistake, or do something wrong, but its okay, it happens, you cannot put yourself down about it, because then nothing will ever get done. I know you're able to do this, I know you're able to learn, to get better, to be who you want to be. Its just a matter of trying until it changes. Its never easy to change your outlook, or change how you interface with the world, but you can do it. I believe in you. I hope that you can feel better and not be so harsh on yourself. The whole world isn't watching, you don't have to be perfect, just be you, as good as you can.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<@237753974390915072> I see what you're saying, firstly I'd like to say I'm happy to hear that you are feeling better and getting depression under control, that is really good news to hear and that's a really positive development! Secondly, in regards to the sleeping, are nightmares a side effect of the medication? I know some anti-depressants can have side effects that can warp stuff like dreams. If not, then is it possible that the type of media you consume is ""infecting"" your sleep so to speak? I know I tend to have nightmares after I consume a lot of scary content, so maybe you saw or played something scary and it might be subtly impacting your dreams? I'm not sure, but maybe if one of those two things are impacting you, maybe you can change it to be less mentally destressing. Regardless I wish you the best with this, and hopefully its a phase, or something that you can easily fix!","",""

<@416212519732903937> I know what you mean, I'm bad about keeping orderly, its hard. I think a few tips I learned that help me is to try and incorporate the cleaning into some kind of routine if possible. Like for example when you wake up, you make your bed right then and there and you don't even have to think about it. Or for example, every Wednesday you clean up just the kitchen, and then Friday you clean up just the living room, or some sort of schedule that can become a habit. Another strategy I like to use is to break up tasks. That becomes obvious with cleaning hopefully. Instead of thinking ""I need to clean up this entire house"" I try and think about it in terms of one area, and then if I get done with that, I can choose to do another room. Like Newtons laws of physics, the same rules tend to apply to tasks, the momentum of cleaning one room tends to translate to the next, and if it doesn't, you've at least cleaned one room! Those are a few strategies I try to use to stay on top of cleaning and tiding up the space. I wish you the best with this and I also wish the best with depression, its always a struggle to do anything when you feel like not getting out of bed. I know that feeling, it gets better though, positive change tends to snowball!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<@108641153397559296> Hey, I feel like I understand what you mean. Losing someone is so hard, I'm sorry you have to go through that. It really sucks, but regardless, I understand what you mean about feeling lethargic and forcing yourself to do things. I've been there, its hard, but you can get out of that rut, it takes time, grieving takes time, pain takes time, hurt takes time. You just gotta keep trying to get better, keep trying to do you and do your best. I believe in you, I know you have fortitude, I know you aren't one to not fight, even if it takes all day, you can do it, even if you feel like you cant, I know you can. I try meditating sometimes when I feel in a rut, and when I try and look at everything from an alternate perspective, sometimes it makes me feel better. I hope things get better, If you need to talk or anything let me know okay? My time is free, and you can always hit me up, even for just whatever, it doesn't have to be like, mental health related.

<@525013880553078795> I'm sorry that I could not get to respond to you last week. I wanted to but I was just unable to and I feel bad about that, hopefully you don't mind! Regardless, I know what you mean, like everything is ""too good"" and that you're in the eye of the storm for the world of pain. The truth is that its gonna be okay, we're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay. Maybe you don't believe this now, but its going to be true, even if you feel like it will never be true. You cant feel guilty about not feeling horrible. The struggles we carry on our backs and the issues we have... They can be so so tiresome and so much, but that's no reason to hurt and put yourself down when you are trying your best internally to not give up. You cant give up, and I know you aren't the type to give up, you gotta just keep going. Even if you are not ready for the sun, it cannot always be night, the dark goes away, the sun comes, sunshine. You gotta just keep trying to reach that sunshine, y'know? I know you can do that. I dunno if that makes much sense, but I think that's the best way I can put it into words. I hope that maybe makes sense, but yeah, I hope you feel better, and whatever demons are plaguing you can be put at ease. If you need to talk I'm always here y'know.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (4)"

I have seen some very beautiful people who think they're ugly because of some super small detail in their face, or body that no one else notices or cares about. Its just silly, there's no need to be so harsh about yourself, you are you, and you are beautiful as you are y'know? The same argument goes for being ""too boring"", who are you too boring in comparison to? Why do you think that? I know a lot of really cool people who think they're super boring because their hobbies are ""too niche"" or something like that, but its not true. A hobby is just a passion, and you have passions, you have things that you excel at. Those are super valid and like, super okay. Not everyone is cut out for every type of person. I don't know too much about you but I can tell you that everyone finds passion attractive, passion + confidence is the key to someone's heart, and I know you can show both, you just gotta keep trying! I'm really proud of you for going out of your way to try and for example, make conversation with a girl in your zone for your hobby, even if it did not go perfectly. like, 90% of guys are too afraid to even try, trying puts you above a large majority of men, and that's a skill no one can take away from you. You just gotta keep putting yourself out there, even if it feels bad. The only way for it to not feel bad is to just keep trying, and honestly? to keep failing, failing makes it easier to fail which makes it easier to eventually succeed. You just gotta keep trying alright? Don't put yourself down, nothing is less attractive then someone who thinks they're not worth anything. You need to believe in yourself, and I know you can, and I know you will. I'm very sure of it alright? I hope any of that was helpful. If you ever wanna talk more about it you can always feel free to pick my mind a little bit.

<@171824945003888640> I am heartbroken to hear that, The loss of someone you love a lot is really painful, I know that pain. Human, animal, anything. It doesn't matter, the pain is the same, the grief is the same. Im sure Midnight is somewhere better, and happy, you gave him the best 13 years a cat could ever have. You cant control time, you can't change the past. Now you just have to grieve as best you can, and move forward remembering what Midnight meant to you, even if it feels like you cant take it. You have to embody the type of person that brought him so much love, and safety. I've said this before, but as Mr. Hathaway said ""Someday we'll all be free"" someday we will all be connected. I don't know if you are a spiritual person, but if you are, I am sure that his spirit and yours will be reunited some day. Thank you for doing your best to turn pain into a positive message, love your animals, love those close to you. Sometimes, just giving a call to a loved one can mean so much, and we don't even realize it as people. I can only give my deepest condolences for your loss. If you need to talk more about it, I am here for you.","","üíö (2)"

<@203069457717788672> Aww, I'm sorry to hear about that. It *really* sucks when you find a job that is perfect, and you are excited for, and the hand that fate deals you isn't right. Brighter days will soon be here! its hard, it took me like 4 months to get my first job, I know that feeling of anxiety. It will get better, fate will smile on you, just gotta keep following the ways, follow the path keep trying. You can do it, I am very confident of that! You are a hard worker, and I know you're not a quitter. You just have to give 'em hell, eventually you will find the one. It is possible and I know you can do it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<@559923510076506127> Heh, yeah I know exactly what you mean, I have been there and done that. Everything you say is something I have felt or thought or done. I mean, even the fact of how I lay out these responses, is how I have learned to cope with this sort of thing. I can only give so much to others before hurting myself. its just one way I make things easier for myself. I just cannot always immediately respond, things move fast, I can try and hold on tight, but I just sort of have to keep my self respect and stop myself from getting sucked up and drained. If you needed to hear it, then yes, you are not alone, I know what you mean, I get what you mean. I have a few things to help myself but if you want to hear those just let me know okay? Otherwise, I hope you feel better and don't drain yourself trying to help others. If someone is drowning, you cant drown yourself to save them.

<@332296091745779715> Firstly, happy belated birthday! Secondly, yeah I feel you. I just had my own birthday like, four or five days ago, and it sort of struck me that I spent it just studying, I didn't see anyone, I didn't have any celebration, I didn't do anything. It felt so melancholic, but that's just life sometimes. The day itself sometimes just doesn't matter as much as the excuse you have to get together with someone and celebrate. I hope you got that chance to celebrate your birthday!

<@156484620697862144> I am really sorry I did not get to respond to this message when you needed it most, but if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, please know I always am okay with being messaged, I cannot promise the most immediate response but I can promise one.

<@272550723529605121> I am sorry to hear, abusive relationships really leave a scar, mentally, physically. I know we've talked about this issue before so all I can do is reiterate the things I've previously said. I hope you can keep trying to grow, and I hope you have a support system around you that can help. I hope things get better, and I hope you can keep trying to grow. I don't remember if you have a mental health professional you can go to, but if not, you should consider getting in contact with one, since they might be able to give more effective advice and consultation. Life is hard, and I hope you can find something to help you make it easier. I hope things get easier. It can take a long time to get over a bad relationship, but I know you can do it. Trying your best is all that can be expected.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (3)"

<@148479512261296129> I am sorry for your loss. I have lost a few high school friends, and its always just... so weird. Like you have these memories of this person and they're not here anymore, and so all that remains of them is those memories. The loss of someone is just so painful I know. I hope you can grieve their loss, and I hope that can heal. Losing a friend is just, fucked. I don't have many words I can give, but I hope it helps you out somehow to know that my heart is with you. If you want to talk about it, let me know okay?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<@245108667953709058> Its a touchy subject for sure, and how you feel about it is the most important thing. If I can input my opinion, I think that you are right, I also think that a lot of people with mental illness suffer in silence. They learn to cope with their illnesses through blending it in. A lot of people have misguided perceptions of mental health. A lot of older people especially, some of them come from a place of hate sure, but a lot also come from a place of ignorance, mental illness by its definition is not something you can physically see, something you can physically suffer. A lot of people just don't understand because they just don't see it y'know? At least your mom was supportive, that's a good sign, I hope that regardless of what happens with your results, she supports you, and likewise I will too.

My mom got a job after a long time and is already talking about quitting. She's had 3 jobs now where she couldn't stay there even for a month, which fair, was mostly due to medical problems, but now she's being told to just leave, because she's not suitable for an entry level job involving computers. I got her a laptop, to teach her stuff, but I haven't done anything yet, as there's no time for it. She genuinely doesn't know how to operate a computer, navigate internet, type etc.
She can't do manual work for medical reasons, and only graduated high school.
I don't know what she's gonna do. We're slowly bleeding money, all what's left from dads life insurance.

Meanwhile I'm planning on quitting in work, cause I want to go to uni, get a degree to actually make a living wage, but I feel like it's irresponsible. My mom still doesn't know about it, nor do my co-workers, and a lot of stuff is changing, making me uncertain. Even if the work isn't for me, even when the work is toxic, I fear what will we do about money. This whole situation is profoundly fucked.

Therapy would involve asking questions honing in on how you actually feel, and why you feel that way. It could go beyond this specific issue to see if maybe there's more going on in your life that influences the way you feel about this particular issue. It would probably also ask you to come up with some ways to resolve this conflict, and then in follow up sessions reflect upon this, important to note here is that the therapist is a facilitator, asking the right question to help you express/understand your own feelings better, you're doing the heavy lifting.
 
Now I'm not a therapist and I'm not guiding you through anything, so take everything I say from here on out with a grain of salt üòã 
From what you've told me it seems that your dad and brother not being able to keep anything clean might not be the real problem. It could be that that is just a symptom of you feeling powerless and them not following rules you've agreed upon (or maybe it isn't).
So again, it's mostly for you to try and figure out how to deal with the situation. But as I see it there are a few general things you can do, you can focus on trying to change the behavior of your dad and little brother (or maybe the power dynamic in the household). Now you can't force these things, so there's a possibility that this won't work, in which case you can't change the situation, but instead the way that you react to it. 
As example you can maybe put some consequences to the rule, no rule works without enforcement <:jphNyeh:814618628073979966>. Maybe you could think of something that you can use as leverage, giving you more power. And one extreme example... if really nothing is working out, and it's really really bothering you.... maybe moving out is the best thing. 
Again, there's thousands of other things to try first, like for example just talking to your dad and brother, understand their viewpoint more. 

Hope this helps!","",""

This is my first time posting here, sorry if this doesn't fit for this channel. I had a real Shinji moment today. For the past few months, I've been battling some pretty bad social anxiety. Nothing debilitating, but enough to keep me home and depressed about my interactions.
I've been taking measured steps to increase my tolerance of uncertainty by challenging my social anxiety. Some examples include going to a bar by myself (if you wanna search through my chat history, I posted about it months ago). Not all of them are great, but I've been making great strides as of late.
Jump to the beginning of this month. I frequent a game store where I had been building up my courage to talk with some regulars. Sure enough, after a few months, I finally asked someone for their discord friend tag. Not only did they give it to me, but I actually had the courage to message them. We've been talking on and off for a few weeks now.
Also, I made the leap to get to know my co-workers better. Before, I kept everything to work and never talked about my interests. However, when one co-worker invited me to a concert, I pushed myself to go. That last Friday was one of the first times in the last 5 years when I felt normal.
I had forgotten this feeling. At first, this was met with a lot of depression and anxiety. I didn't know who I was anymore. I thought a part of me was dying. I couldn't recognize why I was doing what I was doing.","",""

Then I had a talk with a ""friend"" of mine. She pointed out that the most vulnerable emotion isn't shame, guilt, or anxiety. 


It's hope.


I hadn't even realized I could be hopeful for my future. I was so intent on being alone, being ""independent"", not relying on others for my own happiness. I couldn't imagine that I was afraid that the uncertainty I didn't foresee would be positive.
When I was walking home, I made this connection. Honestly, it felt like the last scene in Neon Gensis Evangelion. Something clicked in my brain that allowed me to feel hope for the first time in years.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (12),ghosthug (13)"

The days leading up to last wednesday i was increasingly lower mood and energy, im not depressed or anything it's just following my own mundane life. Then last wednesday i think of want to play rts multiplayer, since i have never tried it before, and for that seven days aside from basic survive thing like having meal, (barely)sleep and bath, i did *nothing* but play rts offline, play rts multiplayer, looking up and discussing rts with people. I cant find myself to stop it even though i want to.

Now it's subsided to a degree. 

Before that, there was sale of king of fighter 15 and blazblue on steam, and for that week i also destroyed my own life, albeit not as severe as this rts week. I did nothing but play kof and blazblue with friend, as well as looking up and talking about them with friend. It also took one week to subside before i went into normal daily life schedule.

so while i think 'forgetting' can indicate security and not necessarily irresponsibility, i think that part of a healing process is accepting them (for me, that's something along the lines of knowing ""this **is** something i did and i'm not ashamed or guilty of it"") as a part of metabolizing your feelings (processing the consequences for your conditions and identity; you may not have the support and resources to do so completely at this moment)
so while treating or covering them may or may not be a part of that process, and i take no active issue with those ideas, i don't think scars are something that must provoke shame or be hidden, and that you can live with them comfortably and safely

I just woke up and I don't really want to get up. It just feels pointless. By it I mean... well, everything. Getting up, eating food, taking care of myself, playing games, talking with friends, doing work, finding hobbies... it just feels like it doesn't matter whatsoever. I don't feel the drive to live, to do anything.

It also feels like I'm trying really hard to find something, anything, that will make me feel happy and make life worth living, but I just can't. I feel stuck.

I just slept for 12 hours and I just want to go back to sleep. For some reason, in my dreams I just feel... happy? I have that ""drive"", I feel motivated, I want to do things, to move forward.

And then I wake up and just... lay there, remembering that I have to wake up and do things while knowing that in the end it will amount to nothing. Nothing really matters. But I have to force myself to get up and move. And it's so difficult to just, do it. I want to go back to sleep...

This kind of thing also overflows into other subjects, like for example, the whole trans thing or relationships or.... well, everything. It's like my brain is fighting for me to keep me alive and trying everything to maybe find something that will make me happy with my life. I'm scared that I'm just, subconsciously faking my trans-ness because it's a goal I can strive for and at the end when I reach it I'll realize yet again that I am not happy because there's no where to go from there. It's over, done, meaningless in the end. Same with relationships. I'm scared, I don't know what to do, I feel extremely resigned.

She wants me to and I would rather ruin my life than ask her for any sort of help, because it comes with the kind of emotional strings attached that mean anything I trust her with will be used to center herself.

I guess a big issue is that deep down, the way she brings up things she did that have legitimately messed me up makes me immensely angry and I can't just casually talk about that with her. I'll spent too much energy just trying to control my tone and face. Like yeah, I feel bad for her because she's been through her own traumatic shit and I know she cares in her own way.

I've just been so self-defeating, so afraid of a certain outcome, that I've been self-sabotaging and making that outcome way more likely. But in the end it seems that everything still turned out well... despite my own best efforts to make it not so <:Valle:458329445741101056> .

So a heavy weight has been lifted of me, but at the same time a new heavy weight is being placed upon me.
I'm, I guess, such a lazy spoiled brat that I've not been doing anything for the past 6 months in regards to study or work.
And now I gotta turn that ALL around and start being a responsible adult, working (and still studying), while making a career.
First of all I gotta get my language proficiency for both Dutch and English up to C1 level (cause that's kinda the bachelor level XD).
And I gotta work on promoting myself, so I can score some kind of Traineeship (cause that's what I want). 
And lastly I gotta basically switch from working practically 0 hours in a week to 40+ hours.... but I'm excited ^^

I'm happy and afraid <:RecetteUwaa:442736750968832021>","","pog (6),ghosthug (4)"

I don't know how I got here, I don't know where I'm headed. I've wasted this day away like any other. Really a shame, but what's done's done. 
My life is so empty. I have no real direction, or motivation. I hate it, I hate myself for not doing anything about it. I can't be bothered. I keep hoping my life will somehow punish me. I feel like I don't have the self control to live my life.
Today I've spent most of my day with my dog, while the rest of the family was on vacation. My sister was at work, and afterwards took me to a cafe. That was nice of her. I feel bad about not really feeling much relief from it. 

I constantly think there's something wrong with me. At this rate it could be anything. Why can't I get help? Why am I so scared, and overwhelmed after all these years?

i glimpse at my arm and get reminded of the worst moments of my life.
 wherever i look at a new intrusive thought appears. ive been good for a few months now and i dont want to ruin it but i just keep getting them.||
every thought is amplified and i cant stand it.
i dont know if im getting used to the meds and need readjustments but at that point im going to think that im too dependent on meds and that ill never get actually better.
this mood shift could also be caused by the stress i get from my ex but i end up thinking that i cant handle evem the slightest bit of anxiety because it gets worse so so fast.
its useless to ask people for help really, because whenever someone comes up with an advice i have another problem

I was hit by a wave of longing and sadness, and tried remembering him, but that's not how memory works, so of course I couldn't recall much. This realization has made me even sadder .
Right at the end of the song I remembered dads worsening condition, and his final moments, and the stuff leading up to it. I'm still filled with sorrow and grief, and wish things were different, even though I know that mindset only makes this worse.
Most of the time I don't really think about it, but sometimes it sneaks up on me, and gets pretty visceral. I was lying in my bed with my eyes closed, and just replaying the events how I remember them, and my final visit will forever be burned into my memory. I can't imagine the fear and agony he's had to go through.

Yesterday i had a very sad and weird dream. It started from a blurry vision from my eyes like i just wake up from a very tiresome sleep, then my dad went to go through my room to check if was doing okay but i was barely conscious and he had to hold my body by putting my arm into his shoulders. After that i finally regained full consciousness and my vision became normal, i was in a room with my dad and two other people that i don't recognize in a sofa, and my dad was staring at me wondering if i was okay, but for some reason when i looked at his eyes i started crying out loud and i reached out on his chest to hug him, maybe this is one of the cases where i felted like i was conscious that in that dream and it felt real, i believe i cried because i wanted to get off something out of my chest for him and being honest with myself and my personal problems.

After that my dad went away with the other people probably discussing about my condition, then later on i found myself sleeping in a bed again but still conscious of what was happening around me. I noticed that i was in a tall building and the setting looked very fantasy-like, a lot of the buildings in the area looked blue and white and there was a festival right below the building in the streets.

I've woken up to stress dreams every day of the week. I've talked about it here before, but I was in a bad relationship. My thoughts are clouded on it, which is part of the issue, but generally speaking it wasn't healthy and I've clearly got a lot of mental baggage as a result of it. These stress dreams I keep having are always about my ex. I don't remember any of the details, but usually we're just... friends? Sometimes in a relationship again? If nothing else, there's contact. It's been about three years now since I cut contact with her.

Generally I'm doing a lot better. Practically, I have a lot to look forward to. I'm graduating this semester, even though it doesn't feel real. I'll be starting grad school for a master's in the Summer, and that doesn't feel real either. Not in a bad way, just in a ""oh, it's actually happening"" kind of way. I don't know how to feel about it. I'm not sad, but I'm not particularly happy for my own sake. My parents and relatives are excited, but for me it feels like I didn't really do much. I barely studied. I haven't read any required texts in years. I've turned every major assignment in late this semester. I still get A's and B's.

I feel like I've been in this... fog since my relationship ended. There are moments where I come out of it and I feel good- no, I should rephrase that. There's this fog that comes around, and sometimes I think it's gone for good. It's not the default anymore, but I can remember a time when every day was foggy. Now it's just every now and then. I'm rambling.

I feel like... I put everything I had into being in a relationship. It started when I was 16 and ended when I was 20, and it was my whole world. I was dating my first crush. Things moved fast, and we always seemed to get along. Any troubles were smoothed over.","",""

If there was a problem, we talked about it once and assumed it was settled. It was... hell, I don't think talking about this helps anyone. I've reflected on that enough. It's not the issue now, anyways.

The issue now is that I'm still not over it, and I don't know why. I keep longing for what I had, and I don't know why. I keep checking up on her, and I don't know why. I know I'm doing better now, so why am I not over it? I know she treated me like shit, so why do I miss being with her? I know that if she mentions me at all, it's to put me down, so why do I check up on her? I don't get it. Do I want to feel that hurt? Is that it? Do I think I deserve it? That it was all my fault, and I need to inflict something - anything - upon myself as punishment?

I know that's not it, but sometimes I wish it could be that simple. I wish I had an answer that wasn't so grey. I just... I look at where I'm at, and I compare it to her. Always.

I'm sitting here alone at 23. She's the same age, and she's engaged. She's getting married to the love of her life, someone she loved enough to cheat on me with. For some reason I don't blame her. I've gone over it in my own head so many times - compared my notes against hers so much - that the only conclusion I have is that I deserved it. Of course I did - what other answer could I find, looking there? It's almost 3 AM, and I'm sitting in bed pretentiously venting. Writing down my thoughts like it's an essay.

There's no danger. Those arguments I always win will never actually happen. I wouldn't want them to anyway. I look at pictures of her now, and I don't even feel that love anymore. I don't recognize her - why should I? It's been three years.

There's nothing there anymore, so why? Why does my chest still feel so hot? Why does my bed feel so empty? Why am I jealous of a life I don't even want?

I think I'm jealous because it looks simple. I don't have the full picture for anyone but myself, so of course the framing is so nice when I take a peek at someone else's. I just feel so... disconnected. Like I spent all my formative years watering a plant, and then it died.

Hell, I don't know what to say after that. I'm just tired, I guess. Tired of questions I don't want to ask and answers I already knew.

I think back on my relationship, and I'm not even sure there was romance to it. There are flickers of some dates. Sitting in the city, feeding dry cereal to birds. Visiting the conservatory. Vague lunch dates of little consequence. 

I think if I had to try and articulate it, I always kind of felt like we just happened to be dating. Like I could have been anyone else, and it probably would have been fine to her. Right time, right place. It's not as if she didn't care about me or for me, but... I don't know, I'm left with the sense that she didn't care about *me.* Like I was a service that could provide for her. Not one that she was ungrateful for, but one that wasn't necessarily essential or all that unique. I'm sure my own feelings of insecurity and inferiority played some part in it, but a couple of factors regarding how it all ended obviously don't help either. Being cheated on is obviously a big hit.

The long story short is that out friend group had another relationship in it, and her and the girl in that relationship often talked about their relationships. Just girl talk and all that jazz. Apparently during one of those chats, my ex said something to the effect of ""I'm only with him out of convenience. I'm just waiting for something better to come along."" That person told me this after I cut contact with my ex, kind of as a way of strengthening my resolve in the decision, I think. Ultimately I'm glad I heard it, but obviously it does sting to hear something like that, even secondhand.

I think about it a lot, as you might guess. It's... well, it's a downright shitty thing to say about another human being. No way around that. It's just downright dehumanizing. In some ways it makes me feel like shit, but that's no surprise. In other ways, it gives me strength. Strength in my decision, in knowing that I made the right choice to cut her out of my life. Hard to imagine you made the wrong choice when the other option is staying in contact with someone who views you as a convenience.

But I think about it a lot. With how things shook out, it's clear she didn't give a damn about me, and yet she still offered to be friends. I was the one who cut contact. I had to do that. Makes me feel like I'm the one who made things go south. Makes me wonder if I didn't do that, if we'd still be friends at all. Makes me wonder if the stuff she says about me is the truth or just something she made up to save face. Ultimately it doesn't really matter. It's not like I can ask her, and even if I could I have no reason to trust a single word she says. Just useless thoughts. Questions that aren't even looking for answers.

It's a lot. Talking helps, sure, but sometimes it doesn't help as much. Only so much I'm comfortable sharing, and only so much I can really articulate.","",""

So I went and ||got a surgery the same day. Since this was on my back I had to lay on my belly the entire time and got some local anesthesia, which luckily blocked 99% of the pain. It still was incredibly messy. They had to cut open the abscess and carve it out. So it was a weird experience feeling someone doing that while your own blood splashes down your shoulder.

Today at work, completely out of the blue, for the first time in my life, I had my first major experience with the feeling of ""Dissociation.""
I have no idea what caused it, why it happened, or why this is the first time I've ever experienced it, without any previous indication of something that would cause it. All I do know is that it was absolutely terrifying. 
The feeling that everything in the world around me wasn't real, the feeling that I wasn't real. 
I spent what felt like ages, scrolling through Messages I had sent to other people previously, messages that other people had sent to me in the past, poems I had written before, objects in my backpack I had brought to work, just *anything* that would convince me that I'm someone who exists, that everything around me exists. For about 3 hours I was completely disconnected from reality. I didn't know what to do, so I just opened a notepad and started typing to try and describe what exactly it was that I was feeling in that moment. 
I'm feeling more ""Grounded"" at the moment, but I was absolutely terrified, I genuinely felt that I was dying, that everything I was seeing was some hallucination like what someone experiences in their final moments of brain activity before they die, like any second my mind was just going to shut off.

I want to get finally diagnosed with ADHD, but I'm scared and don't know where to start, because I always doubt the choice of the clinician. It's expensive, and I literally can't afford to chose badly. I also want to get checked for autism, but my country is a damn shit hole, and makes that very difficult for adults, plus it's way more expensive than adhd thing. 
I tend to give up on all of these things daily, I just can't do it. It makes me depressed, and then I spiral into self hatered, and there's no way to logic out of that state","",""

||my childhood abuser, my younger brother's father, is dead. Killed himself in a drunken rage last night, idk if it was accidental. 

I feel no relief at knowing this. He's been out of my life for over 15 years, but the news brought back a flood of traumatic memories that I haven't recalled in ages, almost 10 years of living in near-constant fear.  I've taken the next couple days off work for ""bereavement"" because this is all too overwhelming

Everyone I've ever told about it has been out of my life for years, my brother was too young/not born yet to experience most of it, and my mom has deluded herself into believing none of it (including his abuse of her) happened. Only my older sister is around who knows, but we are hardly in contact

He went on to start a new family, none of them know about what happened, and now he's gone. I don't even know what I'm feeling||","","ghosthug (9)"

First and foremost, it's important to know that whatever you end up choosing, things are gonna end up fine. It's a stressful patch, but eventually things'll normalize again. I was in a situation like you are now once, and in retrospect I've found that just reminding myself of that can be helpful when it feels like I'm making an important decision.

As for that decision, my personal opinion is that you hold off on making any attempts to convince her. In my experience, a situation like this is about the other person's needs and wants first. I want to apologize in advance if this sounds blunt, but I'm having a difficult time conveying what I want to say otherwise. It was her choice to end the relationship for reasons related to her own feelings or lack thereof, and feelings are something which generally cannot be convinced to change. Your own feelings are naturally going to be very strong about her since you were still happy with the relationship, but it's important to consider that she likely felt just as strongly that things were not working out.

As you said, you know that both of you need time and space at the moment: I urge you to think of yourself with that sentiment. Give yourself the time to adjust to life in the absence of a relationship, and give yourself the space needed to feel normal outside of one. Unexpected change of any kind is frightening, and the natural response is to try and put things back into the place that they were. Sometimes, however, things need to change. Sometimes something doesn't fit anymore because other things around it have shifted. Sometimes a comfortable fit becomes uncomfortable.

At the end of the day, only you can make the decision on what to do next. Regardless of what you choose, I do hope that you consider my advice, if indeed it's of any use to you. Best of luck.","",""

"190188039719485440","jelly386","2023-05-12T16:30:07.4510000+00:00","I think the most important thing is to be open and honest about your feelings and intentions in this situation. If you're set on telling her, I think you should be up front about your own feelings regarding the relationship and regarding her. Make it clear that the decision is ultimately hers, as - once again - that is overtly the case in this situation. She made the decision to end things, and by that right it should also be her decision for how things progress. Above all else, respect the decision that she makes if and when this conversation eventually occurs. Love that fizzles out can leave fond memories, but love that refuses to let go can turn all of them sour. If it's over, let it be over.

And regarding your connection with others, I would highly, *highly* advise you to make a concerted effort to connect more closely with the friends that you do have. When I was in a relationship, I diverted all of my attention to it to an unhealthy degree. When it eventually ended, I felt completely lost and disconnected from anything in my life, leaving the desire for that relationship as my only drive. It took me a long time to work through those feelings, but on the other end of them I am both horribly saddened that I neglected my other relationships during that time and immensely grateful for the friendships that I had and still continue to cultivate in the present. It won't be easy - in fact, I still struggle greatly when it comes to forming connections with other people - but I cannot overstate how essential it is for your personal wellbeing. People usually require a network to function, and while a romantic relationship may feel so powerful and fulfilling that it makes you believe you don't need anything else, the truth is that believing in that can be dangerous. They are an important connection, but they cannot be the only one.

Once again, all I can offer is advice based on my own experiences. The choice is yours and, ultimately, hers to make. Best of luck.","",""

What I'll write here might feel like attacking those who're part in LGBT, I promise you this is not written on that intention, but purely because I want to know what I have to do. Please read this with an open-mind and not be judgemental to anyone I say here as much as you can, because that's not why I write this.

I live in Indonesia, where it's a muslim-majority country and where lgbt are a thing that is still being viewed negatively, despite the growing movement, my parents are included in that majority.

My parents has a strong ties to muslim and traditional culture. Although from what I see my parents is actually quite rational and tolerant to strange who are different to them, it's just that they won't be really positive towards someone who isnt muslim or Indonesian or both or not considered good in their view, to be someone close to them or their family, like me. My parents always say that it's okay to know and talk to all kinds of people, but only makes friend with those who has strong believe in Islamic values.

I have been in some serious depression for a long time that made me ran away for 2 and half months until my parents found me for searching all that time. Until now they (most likely) still don't know that I have depressed thoughts, or (they secretly know but they don't understand how to help me with it), they only understand that I ran away because of their pressure and my pressure throughout college and to decrease my body weight. But even if they don't understand, I appriciate them trying to help me as much as they could, and I want to be more honest and open about what I feel both to myself and to everyone, including them.","",""

Being open includes me telling them about a circle of online friends that I've had for almost 5 years and pretty much my comfort zone, they're all Indonesian and most of them are muslims but for a long time my parents haven't approved me having online friends. But now after me running away they decided it's okay as long as they know who they are and that they are good. And so far it has been going good but...","",""

So here's the problem, some of my friends in that circle are what would my parents consider as bad, and their occasional topic is definitely something they wouldnt be able to tolerate. My circle is pretty liberal and occasionally talks about lgbt-related stuff, and some of them are even part of lgbt themselves.

But for my parents, if they see this, this would definitely something they won't tolerate, they haven't see anything of this, but if they do, they will think I am a part of lgbt myself, or even if I can convince them, they will still think that the circle has a very bad influence and that I have to leave that circle for good.

For myself, I have never mind lgbt people and community, I don't really know where my moral lines in, and they are definitely contradicting each other because of my Islam identity and family's influence, and because of western media and that circle's influence. From what I see, this is two moral standard that's completely and naturally opposing each other, and no matter what each sides will think that their side is simply righteous and the other side is the ome who should change, and that honestly confuses me.

But aside the dilemma, the most important is how am I supposed to keep being open to people if something like this exist between friends Im constantly talking with and my family? I guess I'll keep trying to keep it hidden, but I wish there's just a way to get my parents to compromize. And I don't know what will I do if my parents find out about the lgbt stuff in my circle.

No matter how I think about it, there's no way that I can make my family understand if they see it, and I will most likely just going to start hiding stuff from them again...","",""

For example, you may be able to generate a picture that is better than anything you can draw and maybe will ever draw, but it's not like you actually drew it, you generated it. That's why I am still interested in drawing, since I enjoy the process of drawing the picture, rather than only focusing on the end result. And while the end result is part of it, even if it's worse, its still 100% mine. I then focus on improving and slowly work towards something I can be proud of (That's not to say there is not any skill involved with AI generating, but it's a different skillset is all I'm saying). I use drawing as a creative outlet where I can see improvement and feel like I'm actually doing something with my time, which AI generation just doesn't provide for me, so I pay it no mind.
If you derive your passion for said interests only from the end result this answer might not help you, but maybe it got you a different perspective on the whole ordeal. Any hobby will have down phases where you're not okay with the progress you're making or you even think you're getting worse and with AI being such an easy shortcut it's understandable that you could get discouraged by it. It's not an ideal situation, but I think as long as you're having fun with it there's no real reason to be worried about something being able to do it better than you  (unless you want to do it as a job, then you might need to bite the bullet and learn AI generation, but that also doesn't make it impossible for you to do it without it on the side).
And also, as with any online discourse, try to stay away from it on bigger platforms with bigger communities, like twitter or youtube comment sections, etc. that shit is only going to get you mad and feeling bad (bars), theres no value to be gained by reading and/or engaging with it.

I don't really have any fun with them, and I'm not good, but I still feel an extremely strong compulsive *need* to play fighting games. They're in front of me constantly, everyone in gaming communities that I care about is really into them. My IRL friends are big into fighting games, but played in a healthy and social way.

But I can't play in moderation at all. I lost basically my entire Sunday to street fighter yesterday, and it was miserable past hour ~3. I just can't interrupt myself, can't set a boundary time, can't say ""one more set and I'm done for the day."" It sucks watching your free time evaporate as you just mindlessly keep jumping into another set over and over. 

They bring out such a bad version of me, full of self-loathing. The version of me who binges these games even brings back the extremely childish, immature coping mechanisms of self-harm for venting frustrated energy. Nothing actually dangerous of course, just punching myself, not anything actually harmful like cutting. Just this childish fury at my own incapability and failure to improve as a person and a player, that gets vented into a need to punch my legs, arms, body, or face.

And no matter how many times I try to break out of this behavior loop, it always, *always* comes back. A reinstall of Guilty Gear or Street Fighter is never more than a couple weeks away at most. I don't know if it's dopamine, a need for validation, or something of actual consequence, but it sucks to be such a manchild that I completely degrade into a gelatinous self-loathing failure on such a frequent basis, for something as simple as what should be a fun and social hobby.","",""

I talk like a disabled person, they say. I'm pretending to be a better person than anyone here, they say. Thay have no respect for me, they say. 
Well, it's undeniable I was wasting my time away recently, and didn't do anything other than procrastinate. 
I'm willing to take responsibility, no need to rub it in. I hate how narcisistic they are. Always pointing out my flaws, while blind to their own.
I want to have some free space for myself, some time to think, and relax. I know I'm not entitled to anything, but I don't care. I want better.
This is something that needs to be worked on to be achievable, but it isn't impossible. 

What really troubles me, is how sharp was my recent mental decline. My mind wants to give up everything in face of troubles. 
I get a lot of suicidal thoughts, about how easy it would be to end it, or how my mind counts with the suicide as something I'll definitely do.

I don't know how she's going to react. I'm not expecting immediate hatred, but I'm also not expecting her to be exactly thrilled with this development, as many Maybes still remain about it. 
I have most of the writing done, its just putting the pieces together. But my Confidence is slowly dwindling, and I'm worried I might be doing this too early. Even though its just ""Hey, this *Might Be* a thing"" I still need to sound confident in presenting that information.

I'm sabotaging my life, and it keeps spiraling down, with no sign of stopping. I don't know what to even say at this point.
I feel like I can't fix it alone, I am so ashamed it's petrifying. I've been doing nothing for the last 3 years, I've wasted so much of my time, and I can't stop myself. I'm so close to the edge, in agony, everything feels hopeless, and I just don't have the willpower to endure much more. 
I realize I post something like this every other week, but it's really how I feel. I'm such a burden to my family and friends, still lying, even though I swore I'd do better. 
I want to scream and cry and just fall apart so bad, but I can't. I don't think my family would survive me doing that.
You know it's bad when your brain keeps telling you to just die to escape, which I don't plan on ever doing, but at this rate... idk if something else breaks.
It seems I've failed the entrance exams, and it's all my fault. I was really serious about it when I've applied, but I could never for the life of me study suggested the materials. I may have ADHD, but we don't know, and even then it's not an excuse. this is the 3rd time I'll be skipping out on uni, unless a miracle happens, and I can find a school that takes me in. I very much doubt it, since most of those have entrance exams, and I won't be able to learn what I need by then. 
It's not only falling behind my friends, who already have bachelor degrees, my own younger brother is starting uni this year, I can't bear falling that much behind. I also lose out on another year of orphan pay, because I'm not studying. I'm actively screwing up my life, and can't get a grip. fucking hell.... I just can't no more, I'll actually lose my fucking mind","","ghosthug (9)"

It simply was not something for me, and I had to admit that to myself. I still found a well-paying job, and live alone now in a decent apartment. Sometimes things seem impossible, and it feels like nothing will ever change, and I hate to say it, but things usually will get a lot worse before they get better. Eventually though, they do get better, and even if you feel like you are failing, and not doing anything meaningful, know that your existence on this Earth is singular and unique, and nobody can take that away from you. If you can, try and start with baby steps, but if not, maybe just give yourself a long time to rest, maybe you just need to give yourself a little space and think outside of what is expected of you.

I really hope any of this helps, and that you can find a way to find what little joy there is in this life üíô","","ü´Ç (2)"

I‚Äôve never had a genuine relationship with anybody, only some acquaintances I can talk to, group chats, classmates etc. Still had somebody to talk to, it‚Äôs just that never in my life have I ever made a conscious effort to connect to people.
So cutting off everyone from my life was by far the worst decision I‚Äôve ever made. At one point got tired of people and took ‚ÄúI need some time for myself‚Äù to the extreme. The years of isolation damaged me so badly I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore. My memory became so much worse, said goodbyes to any communication skills I had (I can barely make coherent sentences sometimes), and now my mind‚Äôs a mess when I need to make even a trivial decision or say something. Because of that, my self-esteem hit the fucking bottom in no time and the stage of self-loathing and anxiety had begun. Thought of myself as a waste that is entitled to absolutely nothing in this world. I also grew progressively more disinterested in my hobbies. Instantly dropped learning Japanese and nowadays the thought of starting drawing again filled me with disdain and regret. Barely anything I watch or play or read brings me joy and all of it gets forgotten in like a week. There was probably some depersonalization going on. Every one of my defining features just vanished. At one point it was so bad I started saying or doing some weird stuff (nothing offensive or outright abusive) just so I could feed on the idea that I am SOMEONE in the mind of other people. Self-deprecation and self-hate was even somewhat comforting.","",""

If nothing changes, things will only be worse, and so the idea of texting some of my old acquaintances and ‚Äúfriends‚Äù popped up in my mind. Took me some will, courage and a couple of months to finally text them (and some avoiding them IRL and the times they‚Äôre online). Broke down crying, because instead of contempt I had been expecting all those years, I was met with kindness. Then I fumbled it all like frame one. All those bottled up emotions exploded in an instant and resulted in me trauma dumping and saying some out of pocket shit that should‚Äôve been kept for the time when those people would get to know me better. Naturally, that drove some of them away from me. Some stayed and there were for me, and, in talking to them, I discovered that every piece of my body was rejecting my actions. I‚Äôve become so accustomed to loneliness that socializing was unnatural to me. Then, the number of conversations I had with people started dwindling, and eventually I came back to square one. 
Thankfully, I‚Äôm past my self-loathing phase and feel like I‚Äôm in a better place than I was before. Still, it doesn‚Äôt mean that I have ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù completely. I may have learned some things about myself and others, but the damage I inflicted upon myself is still there, and some horrible thoughts still remain in my mind. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Like, I tried the best I could and it failed, now what? What‚Äôs the next thing I need to do in order to, errrm, heal. Feels like things will never get better and I‚Äôll be forever stuck in being incomplete. Holy shit loneliness sucks. Fuck off, brain.","","ghosthug (10)"

But that's not an issue of mal intent, like even if what you're saying is true, it's not because people wish harm on those that are autistic. Firstly it's an issue of it probably being very hard for people to interact with someone  that's autistic, be it because they just don't know how to interact with someone who's less sociably able, or just someone who requires... more carefull consideration in how to interact with. And there's probably also a lack of understanding that makes it harder for people to empathisize with the other person, which I think is probably most crucial when they do some socially undesirable things. So in short, most people find interactions with autistic people extreme difficult, but probably not a 'oh I hate this person'  or 'oh they're so weird'. And secondly... I don't think most people feel all that much when they hear about the death of someone that they had no connections too... you'd probably just care about the loss of life at that point in general, but you have no real reason to care anymore than that... just my thoughts <:akarishrug:674369638066290700>","",""

Its such a infuriating mindset to have to feel as if nobody cares about you when you have objective proof that you are loved. Be it a defense mechanism or whatever it inhibits my appreciation for the things I have been blessed with. At times I hate having friends for things they either didn't do or things that are are completely outside their control and so it feels extremely petty to have to ask for constant reminders that I'm not worthless whenever I can't do it myself. Every time it happens I second guess if I have good people surrounding me or if I deserve those people to being with. Of course, I become a jackass for a bit so most of my loneliness is self inflicted.

I guess my biggest issue right now is not knowing how to proceed. None of what I've typed out is new to me and I hate being aware of this problem and not know how to fix it.

Right now I take 15 mg of Lexapro in the morning and 15 mg of Buspar throughout the day. 5 mg at a time for anxiety. I have persistent contamination OCD and fear of schizophrenia. I have reoccurring intrusive thoughts about my fiance trying to poison me. A couple of days ago she tried to feed me at nacho and I turned it down because I had the thought pop into my head that perhaps she'd done something to it. And that sent me on a long spiral. My OCD compulsions are almost purely mental which makes it even harder to differentiate. I cycle thoughts in my head over and over trying to find logical reason. I've been trying to neglect myself that relief because it perpetuates the OCD cycle but it's been very tough of late. It creates this rift in my mind because a part of me loves my fiance very much. And I always have. But there's this other nagging part of me that is having these scary thoughts and it's harder to describe. But it almost feels like a headache or it feels like I don't know it a part of my brain that won't behave or something. And of course that makes me absolutely terrified that I'm developing schizophrenia and I'm in the beginning stages. But that's a fear that I've had for a long time now. And I have seen a professional and they've diagnosed me with OCD not schizophrenia so... I don't know. It tends to come in cycles. I'll seem to get over it for a while or I'll increase my doses of medicine. From 10 mg to 15 mg of Lexapro for example and that seem to help for a while. But then it'll come back usually only for a few days. But it seems to be more persistent and strong this time. Probably because I'm mentally unstable because of what happened to my mom. You know the grief. The depression only aggravates these other sort of problems.

That, if I told them or anyone the whole story, that I would be sectioned, locked in a straight jacked, tossed into the ""Looney Bin"" and never heard from again. And that degree of paranoia has kept me from speaking to one for years, even with the insurance I have making speaking to one (presumably) reasonably affordable. That fear made me think that, even if I did talk to one, I wouldn't be able to force myself to open up, and be honest, and tell them what they need to hear to help me.

But today, this afternoon (As I woke up, late for work, Yet again.) While I was in the shower, I pretended I was speaking with a therapist. And it became clear to me just how much I probably need to speak with one, and, actually wanting to do so. There's so much going on in my head that I don't understand, and as I think to myself ""I don't even get what's going on, and I've been living with it for years, how the heck are they going to understand it?"" I feel like, its a fools errand to talk to one, yet, if merely *pretending I was talking to one* caused certain seals to pop, then maybe I should? I cant be sure, just yet. And its still gonna be a while until I can speak to one.

I'm just scared, mostly. Even when I've been told ""That's not how therapists work, they can't just declare you a psycho and have you locked away for it."" and: ""They only really step in to that degree if there's X Y and Z involved."" But lets say hypothetically, X and Y are involved. What then? I'm just worried that any attempt I make to seek help is going to be betrayed, and ultimately make things worse. A fear that trying to get help is going to be a worse outcome than just doing what I've always done best: Suffer in Silence and hope things get better eventually.","","ghostHug (4)"

I think sometimes it's good to get them out instead of keeping them in, so I'm gonna do that for a bit, even if I'd just forget them in the morning anyway.

Sometimes I don't feel like I'm real. Not in the sense of ""I don't tangibly exist,"" moreso in the sense of like... I feel like I don't have a direction or an endpoint. I feel like ""who I am"" doesn't really exist anymore. I know it doesn't make sense when I type it out like that. I *am* real. I'm a fully formed person with thoughts, and feeling, and hobbies, and skills, and friends. I know these things. But every once in a while I just feel hollow all of the sudden.

Obviously it all comes back to my failed relationship, no surprise there. I think it's a matter of definitions, specifically self-definition. I've always defined myself in the context of others, and when I was in a relationship, that was pretty much *the* defining trait about me, internally. It was my job. My purpose. My direction in life, obviously to an unhealthy degree. I'm kind of sick of my own rambling at this point, so I'll just cut to the chase. I feel like when the relationship died, my direction died with it. Every time I try to define myself or think about who or what I am, it always comes back to that. I *was* ""Ex's boyfriend,"" but now it's just... a mess. Am I a fuckup who ruined everything? Am I some kind of asshole who did it on purpose? Was I the one who got taken advantage of? Was there really anything exceptional, or was that just what bad relationships are like? Dozens of questions - two for every answer I decide on.

Eh. Maybe writing wasn't the right choice. Feels more like a creative writing exercise than getting something off my chest. Who knows if I even believe any of this shit. I'll feel better in the morning, at least.","","ghosthug (12)"

I have addictive personality to an unhealthy extent (thank God I never touched drugs). When I am in a relationship I am the boyfriend, it's all I think about, my purpose in the relationship, how I can make the other person happy and constantly worrying whether everything is ok (you can read a bit on my current relationship in the messages here a week ago, although my current problems there are different). At the same time, I have a stable job as an academic and a teacher and when I am not in a relationship my addiction goes into my job, I turn into a workaholic and I am pretty happy, it centres me. Whenever a relationship ends for me, due to my personality I spend months feeling like you, just floating around without purpose or direction, lonely and hollow. What has saved me in times like this is channeling my energy elsewhere - as my therapist would say ""make a small garden if you have to, establish a routine, read Shakespeare everyday, do something to focus your mind and to give you purpose"". So in a way, your feeling is completely normal and the advice (which I honestly find really hard to follow myself) would be to find something else to anchor you like the relationship anchored you before. You say you have hobbies, can one of them be intensified to occupy more of your attention, for example? I am just brainstorming here of course but it is something I can relate to and hopefully attempt to help.","",""

First time chatter and unfortunately is  here, but if i don¬¥t vent or write anything that i feel i think im going to do something i might regret.

Im tired, im just too tired to keep going.
There¬¥s nothing for me to keep trying or to be ""proud of"". 
I¬¥ve lost everything i loved, the girl that made me whole, ""friends"" that showed me im just and asset for them, same as for my supposed family.

I lost my job, my psychiatrist moved and cant afford a new one.
Cant afford my meds and Ive been through all of this alone thinking it would get better. It did not. 

And... im just too tired. Too tired thinking it would get better. 
That new people would come into my life.
That things would turn around.
That the change ive made i would be enough to deserve nice things and feel anything else than empty.

Ive been a dumpster my whole life. Tried to put myself first for the first time, and realized that im alone.
You could say that you are not really alone, or that you dont have to seek approval from others, that i need to be better for me.
And thats the thing, if i focus on what better for me and enough for me, then i would¬¥ve been dead.

I tried everything, and i mean, everything. 
Therapy, religion, self improvement, and things that would made me sound desperate. But yeah, im desperate. i just want to feel something.

Ive been feeling like this for 15 long years.

Thinking back it's been really rough. I lost my job due to a previously unknown disease which I'm now getting treatment for, I had to spend 3 months in hospital recovering. Upon leaving the hospital I lost pretty much all of my money due to hospital fees and was told to rest for a month before searching for a new job. When I was able to go job hunting again I had no luck managing to secure a full-time job but managed to get part-time one. 

Even currently I'm still really struggling, it doesn't help that my work is on a temporary pause due to summer holidays but despite that I'm just about able to get by. I sometimes can't help but wonder if I'll always be struggling with money, despite being quite frugal in general. It just seems it's been a lot of coincidences and bad luck which has landed me in this situation, and sometimes it feels like there's no way out. My family and friends offer support but it feels very demoralising that I have to rely on them, meanwhile my friends (who are younger than me) are doing exceedingly well and have started looking into buying a house. I'm super happy for them but it also feels like I've fallen so far behind that no matter what I do I'll never be able to catch up to them.

Ultimately this rant is not a huge deal I suppose, just a dark cloud that will pass in time. I'll keep doing my best, I hope you all can too.","","ü´Ç (11),‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

When you combine all this, it‚Äôs pretty easy to understand, why I struggle with self-expression. Sadly, this writing experiment has devolved into a rant, where I give in to feelings trying to vent, not challenge or face them. It‚Äôs a failure. Oh well, might as well post it anyway.

||its not an easy choice. when my dog got old and got very sick with cancer my dad said that we ought to put her down, without really even pursuing treatments much at all. prolonging the process would have been hard on her and is often not very successful, and she would either way never be her same vibrant self. we didnt want her to suffer anymore past the point that she stopped eating. we didnt want her story to end slowly, outside our control, full of unknowns for her and us, taking on more and more stress with financial costs and worsening conditions. i think it was important to my dad that he was being proactive by making that choice, and in hindsight i agree with him now||

||i think the thing with euthanizing a pet is that in a sense you are taking on a special kind of responsibility, for the sake of your pet. youre taking control and agency in a situation that your pet cant understand it has been saddled with, and choosing to write the ending to their story yourself, in terms of what you can best approximate and hope for as being best for them. rather than letting it be written by the natural world, with its unknown prolonged pains and fears. i think in many ways that is what it means to be a good pet owner - to use the facts of your uniquely human agency to aid in the life of an animal, for their sake, because you love them. so i think thats all you should or could ask of yourself, whatever choice you make. and you should be proud of being brave enough to make a choice like that, in spite of how it hurts||

Which is funny because i thought that i've left my mental health behind. I've had a long battle with it.

I have quit it because I got into a social fight with one of the people in there and got bonked for it. My attitude to this changed quite a few times during the last few weeks.

It's real tiring losing friendships over simple disagreements, and the fact that you stand your ground and say your mind is very noble. It's much easier to regurgitate what other people say, but where's the meaningful connection in that? If you can't be yourself around a friend are they really a true friend? It's also important to realize though that you shouldn't shove your thoughts and opinions into people, even if they end up disagreeing with you or don't understand fully. A simple agree to disagree or a misunderstanding is fine sometimes and as long as they don't maliciously spin your words or is malicious in any other way about it then that's okay.

I totally understand how you feel. I've been way more honest with people and through that I've lost A LOT of potential friendships, but through it all I've gained a most valuable bond that I'd rather have than 100 friends.","",""

I'm doing really badly. 
Wasting my time away, totally aimless. There's a lot on my minds, and I can't get a grip on any of it. 
It's overwhelming.

Yesterday we've had a verbal fight at home. My drunk mom, who's obviously an alcoholic, is distressing to us all, most importantly my little sister. 
My older sister is a violent and insecure hypocrite, who says mom is having problems, yet she doesn't the same, and enables her behavior.
When my little sister brought it up, the older sister lashed out as usual, and forcefully held her by the hands. 
She's always so close to actual physical harm. My little sister cried, since we've lost our father to cirrhosis, and my older sister just kept invalidating her, and telling her to shut up. She's said ""why are you even crying, it's useless"" to a distressed 14 year old. I couldn't take it anymore, and told her, that her behavior is unacceptable, and appalling. We've had a back and forth exchanging insults. Nobody takes me seriously. Then mom came into the room and told me to shut the fuck up, and brought up how I'm a burden to the family, how I should be ashamed, and ""one more word and you're evicted"".
This happens so often, I don't even know anymore","",""

I once thought that too, that I was useless to society (because of infertility, I wondered a lot about keeping on living). But then I asked "" who is valuable to society ?"" I couldn't find a single individual.

Maybe I'm the odd one , an outcast , to think like that but I found my truth : everyone is worthless to society because everyone is a replaceable number, even someone very rich or popular. One single individual might be able to destroy a society with enough influence, however one cannot make a society alone, no matter how powerful he is. The individual is meaningless in the face of the collective.

But this doesn't help , this "" truth "" of mine is unfulfilling "" what can I learn/get from this ? "" I asked. And fortunately for me, I found out pretty quickly. I learned that I doesn't matter what my value is to society. No one should care about such a large scope. 
I learned that what matters is ourselves. The first person who should get value from us is *us*. There's absolutely no reason to worry about what society gets from us. The scope should stay small : us and the people we care for.

All this nonsense to say : don't worry about society, she is going to be fine with or without us. Keep focus on finding value for yourself first. Society can wait and will.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

I was wondering why I felt so much better when not interacting with her for an extended amount of time, but never connected the dots.
She guilt trips us, presents unfair choices like they're the only ones, constantly voices her opinions in a way that makes them supposedly better, and then gets upset at us for not agreeing with her, gaslighting, takes on responsibilities of others without asking and then gets angry with us when we ask her not to do that.
I dont think she wants to hurt anyone but it doesnt really make anything better, as she doesnt seem to want to change either.
She deeply hurt my sister and gave her traumatic memories over the years, and me to a lesser extent.

I do, however, also know, that in my depressive state, I was always expecting the worst out of every situation, and I thought my family would disavow me and call me a failure, even when they ended up not doing so.

He has been a pillar in pretty much my whole life, and the truth is that I am still emotionally attached to him, and so is he to me. We are not perfect by any means, and we depend on each other when something happens to us that affects our mental health.

I'm scared that if he ends up going to a place where I can't reach him, I'll end up falling apart. I'm scared and with the recurring fear that, if he starts battling cancer, he could lose to it. I am afraid that I will be alone again in this world, and that I will never hear his voice again.

What do I do? I am completely lost and I don't know how to deal with this situation in a good way. I have not been able to stop crying for the past 2 hours because I cannot conceive of a world where he may no longer be here.","","ü´Ç (17)"

Even in the case of sickness/old age its different cause the time you spend with them at that point is already with them being tied to a hospital bed, which makes it harder in a different way cause it's so confronting.

What also sometimes helps me is thinking that said loved one would want me to live the best life i could, and wallowing in guilt would only make them sad.

But yeah, shits hard. I'm very sorry for your loss ü´Ç","",""

Yesterday my mom got diagnosed with cancer yesterday :(

And on top of that ive come to learn that the relationship my little brother is in, is fucking abusive. Which just feels like an older siblings nightmare, esp since ive been in one myself as well.

Logically I know it's not my fault, but it's still hard not to blame myself sometimes because I feel like i was way too passive in how i behaved around it. I both didn't realize how bad it was (maybe i didn't want to) and was also scared of pushing him away if i would say too much.

Regarding the cancer news i just don't really know what to do with myself, wether to push myself to still do stuff or stay at home and rest... I just feel like idk what to do with myself","","ghosthug (10)"

||Im a lonley guy. I dont have many freinds, those I do have dont live in my city since i because a student and moved and the city im in doesnt have any third spaces for me that I feel I can hang out at in order to comminicate and find like minded people. Im very progressive and as a straight white guy this can often lead to me finding it difficult to find like minded people. I want to talk about my ideas, my thoughts and discuss with people who wont dismiss me because of politics they dont agree with, and this is just frankly, quite difficult as the communities that often have this are spaces created to house people. I cant join any of these spaces, ones like LGBTQ or PoC communities because I dont belong to them, and communities that do foster people like me are often dismissive or openly opposed against positive social change and acceptance of people. This confines my lonleyness as it means that the majority of my socialising, and thinking takes place online and in spaces where debate is not incentivized. I end up spiraling in on myself because I cannot express myself to others. After the war started, this has just been so much worse. People who I respected, who come to me as humanitarians, who pride themselves on acceptance refuse to denounce the actions of Isreal. they are so caught up on the bombing that they fail to condem a genocide and ethnic cleansing, refuse to acknoledge the war crimes and deaths and destruction. Im in the last week of the school year, crushed in-between deadlines and finding myself unable to move because I am greiving for the killed, paralysed by anger. Ive long since suppressed my emotions and trying to activly engage with them again has just led to me being fucking misreble and angry and unproductive at the end of the year when deadlines are killing the ability to take a step away from this space.

context is that i work overnights at a gas station near me. i met a girl there, S, with whom i developed a mutual crush. eventually we started hanging out and she asked me to move out together. i agreed because i liked her and then two weeks later we also started dating officially, on october 22 2022. we moved into an apartment together with her best friend's boyfriend who also needed a place at the same time. the apartment started in december and had a 1-year lease attached that the three of us signed, excluding S's friend.
for the sake of simplicity, her friend will be F and the roommate will be R.

F, S, and i are all 20yo while R is 24. F has her own apartment already with her brother and his girlfriend. R just moved to the area and was crashing at a friends place  until the apartment. i was still living with my parents and 3 younger siblings who drove me nuts because of my nocturnal sleep schedule. S had been kicked out of her abusive drug-addled mothers house at 17 and staying with her old coworker who had some eccentric qualities that she wasnt a fan of.

S comes from an extremely poor background and hasnt escaped the cycle of poverty yet, so for the whole time we were living together and dating i was covering any and all of her non-bill expenses including groceries, furniture, transportation and car insurance since she doesnt have her own car, clothing to some extent, all our date nights, a laptop, and pretty much everything else you can think of. i wanted her to save up some money and get herself set up with a car and some basics so i could step back a bit.

so we were doing pretty well for ourselves, bills got paid and checks werent too terribly  tight. she was slowly starting to fill out her personal life with things important to her, connect with new friends and reconnect with old ones.

eventually she got herself a stable job at the mall and F helped her get a drivers license. i allowed her to drive my car as long as i wasnt using it first. 

i was also her emotional rock, she called on me to come lay down with her so she could feel safe enough to sleep and the like. and whenever she couldnt convince herself to get out of bed and get to work once she had changed to a daylight job, she woke me up so i could help her to get breakfast ready and pick her an outfit. 

i also opened up to her in a way ive never opened up to anyone before. i was incredibly depressed and emotionally repressed, i hadnt actually cried in at least 5 years but i let myself be vulnerable for her and she was there for it. 

she was my first girlfriend and i was her first non-abusive boyfriend. there were certainly a lot of hurdles to overcome but we tried. there was genuine and obvious mutual love for each other.

R and F had their own falling out, broke up for a week which i supported because i saw that they made each other miserable. but they got back together and eventually mutually agreed that they would stay together until R found somewhere else to rent for himself so he wouldnt end up on the street once our lease ends at the end of november this year.

obviously i was upset at the whole event. the next time we drove anywhere she started making jokes about aggressive driving and crashes and i got quite mad and told her sternly and coldly that she was going to absolutely fuck me over if she wasnt careful. this was the most aggressive thing i ever did to her, im something of a pacifist when it comes to my own involvement in things. but she took it really hard and we were on tense terms for about 2 weeks. eventually we talked and mutually decided against living together after the lease ended, so that we could work on ourselves and refocus what spending time together really meant. 

she got really depressed soon after and was having a harder time than ever motivation-wise getting herself to and from work every day, even though she had moved to a job that is a 5 minute walk away. she called on me to come help her with breakfast, clothes, and transportation more than ever. i was getting extremely tired and sleeping past my alarms for work because of how long i had to stay up to help her but i did it because i loved her.

less than a week later she started asking me to help her get ready for work again like she was doing before. eventually i just started doing it by default because it was constant. i was staying up later and later to drive her to work since i wasnt allowing her to drive my car herself after the crash anymore. i just asked her to wake me up once she got home so that i could spend about half an hour of quality time with her before i had to leave. 

she was fighting back against me whenever i reminded her to take her medicine and antidepressants, and still hadnt gotten a therapist or looked into a car of her own even though literally everyone told her to do both. even though she insisted on being independent, she still asked me for some money time to time to help with groceries. 

then, exactly a month ago, she called me about 3 hours before i had to go to work, and after i had told her i wasnt able to sleep that well that day, and she asked me to come over to F's apartment where she had been sleeping over for the past 2 days (which she did from time to time, not abnormal behavior.) she asked me to come comfort her because she needed support so i woke up on my 2hours 30 of sleep and drove over there. at which point she sat me down on the couch, dumped me, gave some extremely avoidable reasons why, and kicked me out half an hour later.

and she started smiling at me again, and i didnt feel estranged for the first time in almost a month. she accepted a gift that i had bought for her before the breakup but hadnt given her yet, and agreed to play the splatoon splatfest this weekend together. and she asked me and R for help to move some stuff out to his car but she actually pulled me aside and hugged me and started crying with me.

If she's that dependent on others and then turns it around on you to call you abusive, that's a line crossed that should tell you she can't handle having you run her life, even if she asks you to and you think you need to help her. It's impossible to know where the line is between ""helping"" and ""controlling"" when the other person doesn't even know themselves. 
But really sucks to lose a whole group of people in a breakup. She probably only agreed to meeting up to deescalate the atmosphere without intending on following through, which wasn't fair to you but I recognize as a tactic to calm someone down who you feel pressured by. Not saying that that was your intention, but at least from what you wrote it sounds like she still has major issues with how she handles romantic relationships and that kind of conflict handling is what you learn to do when you've been stuck with someone emotionally abusive in the past.

I think a lot of this stems from I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy as I had a seizure a few years ago and had one last year that resulted me in breaking in bone. Yet I remember somehow that it was just nothing. Pitch black and leading up to it felt like I was having a heart attack and that I was dying, then it was pitch black. This made me start questioning if there was an afterlife. I do remain optimistic as I didn‚Äôt actually die so there could maybe be something but having seizures makes me antsy. People then tell me to just live your life to the fullest then but I just can‚Äôt ever seem to get motivated enough with depression and anxiety. Along with that I‚Äôve been told to just not have anxiety since it won‚Äôt matter in the end so I shouldn‚Äôt worry which always frustrates me because I can‚Äôt help but worry about every little thing and I‚Äôm always concerned about my health as I want to prolong my life as long as possible but it always feels like something is wrong with me. Sorry if this comes across as a silly rant but just been struggling with this and wanted to get it off my chest as it just has been making me terrified as of late and filled with dread.","",""

We've talked about absolutely everything from dreams to fears and everything in between. We both have some form of mental health issues and both have a strong understanding of each other. We communicate well and often. We both went through our own separate mental triggers and had our own mental breakdowns and ended up separating two months ago. Well it's been two months and I have had nightmares of losing him, dreams about him and I growing old, etc etc and every guy I see reminds me of him. He checks in on me every once in a while and let's me know how much he loves and misses me and how he hopes for the best and purest happiness for me even if it's not him. I want him in so so many different ways (mostly to die old together and such) and I feel like I can't live another day without him. But again our relationship is very odd and hard to explain. He lives in a ""developmental center"" and I live on my own with two cats. He has taught himself many different things, such as coding, programming, guitar, etc under the sun, and yearns to chase knowledge everyday. He isn't mentally disabled in any way, just has bad ADHD and Bipolar II. I am not able to visit him due to personal issues and therefore we're in a long distance relationship despite living only half an hour apart. I have not seen him in person in well over a year but we call and text everyday, minus our ""break period"" the past couple of months. He wants back together and I want back together but I'm scared bc what if we're not actually meant to grow old together or something? Idk it's rough. He's working everyday on getting out of that facility (NO, IT'S NOT A PRISON) and I get worried wondering when the day will be if it ever actually does come? What do I do?||","",""

im sure its not news to you that the letter doesnt give off the impression of a potential second chance. sounds to me like they just realized you werent fit to be partners from their perspective. and unfortunately theres nothing to be done about it. 
given my extremely limited experience with relationships, i wouldnt get too excited about the kiss or hair. it feels like more of a closure thing and a sign of affection and goodwill than anything else
it sounds to me like they still think highly of you as a person, and appreciated your time together, but they just didnt feel like it worked out. unless im missing some major context from the letter, the other person has already come to terms with that fact. and unfortunately that leaves you stuck having to deal with your own thoughts.
im sorry to tell you, even if they break up with the other guy, you will probably not get another chance. the only way you will get back together is if they ask you first, and thats a decision that they have to make on their own. 
now your job is to think everything through and decide, from the bottom of your heart, whether You yourself will be better off as friends or just moving on. thats going to be a difficult decision, and it will require a lot of thought and willpower either way.

I grew up in Iraq and studied there until 11th grade afterwards my family moved to Turkey and I finished my last year of highschool there during my last year I took the SAT
I was planning on applying to either med school or pharmacy since that's what my parents wanted and I didn't really have any goals
At first i got accepted into a very good university
They even published my name publicly on their website as an accepted student
2 days later they sent me an email apologizing saying it was a mistake and removed my name from the list
And worst of all I discovered later that they sold my seat to someone else that paid money which left me and my family in a bad mood 
It was also around that time where fights with my father were becoming more frequent
Later on I got accepted into pharmacy in another university and things were going well I had to take a language test in order to pass but they gave me 2 years of preparation
I took the test 1 year after I got accepted but before I took the test they changed their policy and now even if I pass the test I have to finish their specialized course which means I wasted an entire year 
Afterwards I took their very expensive course and during the last few months I got COVID and couldn't fully attend 
When I explained this to the university they said that they would freeze my student profile until next year where I had to take another test
Since I had a year of free time me and my family decided to go back in Iraq since we haven't been back in a few years 
While I was in Iraq the ministry of education announced a new law
People who graduated from non-national highschool won't be accepted
So basically my highschool diploma isn't accepted in my country
Which means my university degree also won't be accepted

It was on the day of our 8 month anniversary. It was truly one of the most awful things that has happened to me, and it came as I was just transitioning into college life. My ex, whom I still talk to frequently, realized shortly after that this was not at all what they wanted to do and that they'd made a mistake. But things were complicated, we had been in a polyamarous relationship and the other person he was dating at the time made things too difficult for him to make the decision to get back with me. By the time he broke up with that other guy and asked me back, I had started talking to someone new, and I was still too hurt to consider it a possibility. So I told him to not wait on me, as I didn't want to lead him on. Our relationship ended abruptly and terribly with a lot of fighting over things that I did not understand and he refused to explain. He has a smorgasbord of mental problems, chiefly BPD and Bipolar Disorder. Anyone who has dated someone with those disorders knows that it is a difficult difficult thing. Things since the breakup have proceeded at a bizarre pace. My college life got busy. I started dating someone new. So too did my ex. But we still talk all of the time. Almost every day. We are still the most important people in each other's lives. We are still clearly, deeply in love with each other. But I'm dating someone else, and so is he. I truly do not know what to do. My current new relationship started wonderfully and I clicked with her amazingly. But now, a month in, I just sometimes feel that the two of us are not emotionally/romantically compatible. I also don't want to hurt her, and I care for her a great deal. But I just feel that something about it isn't working for me. I'm seeing my ex today, not as a date just like, we're meeting in person to talk. It's 2 months since we broke up.","",""

I get seasonal depression, it's been a couple of years and try as I might there's a specific date which hits me like a freight train. It's been a couple of weeks and it hadn't hit, for that I have to thank a couple of people.
Still, it finally arrived and struck me in the shape of a needing stranger. (will try to be brief with the subject but I need to get this out) I saw a big congregation of people the other day, religious folk all like myself so I got closer to the group as I was curious. First few words I heard were the praises of a 'miracle' as someone in the crowd said that they 'used to dress like a ma-', they broke down before finishing the sentence while the crowd roared with joy. ''She's back to being beautiful'' - the priest said and I saw red. Were it not for the fact that they looked like they wished to forget about it I would've wanted... I should've done something. All I did was breakdown in a nearby bathroom.
This feeling, guilt and shame, it always come back to it this season of the year. Hell it feels like I'm taking someone's tragedy for my benefit. It feels like I don't deserve to be heard nor cared for.

If you're not sure what you can do, find people you trust and ask them for their advice or support.

A friend of mine just went on a several paragraph rant about how, when I said that when he responded to me as ""The Poetry Girl"" it made me feel warm and fuzzy, because sometimes well, a bit of validation like that makes me feel almost overwhelmingly happy. It can sometimes make my day. 

And he said how he really didn't like the cutesy ""Ehehehehee"" stuff I was doing because it reminded him of a friends Girlfriend who apparently does that stuff excessively IRL. (This is kinda why I don't really act the same way around ""The Guys"" as I do ""The Girls"" I VERY much tone down any cutesy behavior around them, because it might make them uncomfortable.)

And I know he's coming from a place of not knowing, where like, he can't possibly know how important that is, how much that can just INSTANTLY make me feel better and be incredibly happy, just to even hear my new pronouns but like... it just really soured the whole interaction. 

He even said he hopes there's a day where I DON'T get this kind of overwhelming joy from hearing my new pronouns because it should feel normal at that point. And YEAH, he has a point, someday it won't be as overwhelming joyous, because it will feel NATURAL. But in these early days of the process, Validation is worth its weight in gold to me. I just wanted to let him know I appreciated the gesture, and I really do.

I cannot wholly relate but there are times in your life when you just need the people around you to be on your side, to accept you for your growing self and being unable to see past your outside can make it feel so rotten to be dismissed or weaponised against yourself. Its important to know whats important to your freinds, to appretiate what you can help them with, that you can influence them for the better. I think lines like dismissing it as ""pulling the race card"" can really just make it feel like you dont have a right to your reaction. That it is a silly or insignificant, or even an entitled opinion formed by an idiot, but like, hell you felt it because its worth feeling. Its not silly to have your identity threatened, especially with someone you feel open around. Its hard to share something important to you, because it hurts worse when others fail to respect something that matters. It sounds like you may have explained to them already why its so important to you that they use proper pronouns, but maybe its worth saying again if you are comfortable. Maybe even just putting up a boundry phrase, something to let them know that you would prefer if they changed subject or line of speech when you are around them. It might suck to feel that you put limits on your freind group, like you dictate the meetings with you but I think a gentle reminder might help avoid situations like this for the future, maybe something like ""Ok, maybe too far"" or ""Alright, next item"". Things like that make it so when you have an issue like this, you can give them a sign to reflect without escalating the conflict.

In order to not want to be dishonest for social gain, you need to be comfortable with yourself and your own flaws. Which, is a whole ordeal in its' own right. There's no easy answer to becoming more comfortable with yourself, but there are at least many resources for that. And it's completely acceptable to struggle with that; many do.

As far as learning to forgive yourself, there's a lot of things to be said, but I'm going to focus on the practical avenues.
Try not focus on the past. It's not something you can change. Focus on what you do going forward, whether that's opening up to people about how you feel, apologizing to those close to you that you feel that you've done wrong to, and making a concerted effort to change.
It's not a guaranteed path to success. But if you try to make things better, hopefully you can look at that effort and use it to help convince yourself that you're not worthy of being hated.

That said, everyone is different, right? Self-improvement is something that takes figuring out. But I encourage you to try. It's very easy to become defeated and give up.","",""

While wanting to right what you‚Äôve done wrong and make amends is a good impulse, the *preoccupation* with it can be fundamentally very, very selfish. I know you aren‚Äôt there yet, but it‚Äôs important for you to remember; 

You‚Äôre the main character of your story, but you aren‚Äôt of other people‚Äôs. If you have done something wrong in the past, they may have forgotten it. They may have gone through an entire emotional experience because of it. They coped with it in the ways that were appropriate to them. They don‚Äôt owe you forgiveness or even conversation about went wrong. Things played out the way they played out and some won‚Äôt be amendable. 

Like Simple said, apologize where you can, but focus on *doing better in the future* instead of trying to undo things from the past, because it‚Äôs way too easy to get tangled up there and lose sight of the goal, which is to be better in the future. 

We all hurt people and have to live with it. You may have hurt more than most, but you have to forgive yourself, not punish yourself for it, and use it as motivation to do better in the future. I know it is a terrible  truth to live with, but it‚Äôs just part of becoming a better human.","",""

For me it streamed from how I was raised, the details of which don‚Äôt matter much but essentially conditioned me to lie, hide things, and manipulate in order to live comfortably. Then it became habit, then impulse. When I hit college since so didnt really have another way to interact with others while on my own.

I got caught a few times. Especially by a good friend and roommate who is very observational. She told me later on that she noticed a few lies and things I would do but she could understand why I was doing it and never called me on it. Until one time where I went to far in her eyes and she told me everything. Some other stuff coupled with that and we had a falling out.

It was a very good wake up call and helped me work on myself a lot. It takes active effort, and if it‚Äôs truly concerning  therapy is always an option. It helped me get past my impulse to lie to make life easier and smoother.

I know you didn‚Äôt ask for that story but I find it helpful to talk to people who‚Äôve had similar experiences to me and hear their experiences so I figured I‚Äôd put a bit of mine in case you find comfort in the same.

So I'll talk about other parts of it! 

You want to do everything you can, I understand because I've been there. Something you can do that isn't always as intuitive is making sure *you're* okay. 

You can do so much to help, but you can't beat yourself up if you feel like it's not enough, because sometimes it's a problem where the only solution is time passing. If you beat yourself up over it, it'll hurt you both. 

Communicate, especially since it's online. Communication is the foundation of *any* thriving relationship. The happy and the sad. That's easier said than done. For me, I struggled and still struggle with sometimes I *know* what would feel better, and it's hard to say because of myriad reasons

""Oh I don't wanna bother you oh I just wish you'd know Yada Yada"" all just insidious reasons that my mentally ill brain is trying to make up so it's harder to tell my partner what I need. That's not something that comes easy but with love and effort it does come. 

Things that are general purpose is: sometimes its really hard to figure out what would help too, when the head is spicy. Depending on the day it'll be harder or not and if she can't,  you can try. Offering specific options helps someone because they don't need to think as much 

""Hey, wanna watch some One Piece?"" Etc ""but if not, that's okay!""

It's easy to see why the world was such a moral wasteland for the vast majority of the history of civilization. It's so easy for people to dehumanize others, and deny them any empathy. It's pure tribalistic thinking that drives many of the morally depraved takes I've seen, they are the Enemy and that is that. It does go both ways but in the West the discourse is massively biased towards Israel so I think it's more worthwhile to attack that line of thinking in mostly western spaces. The conflict itself does not go both ways I should note, not really. Only one side has the capacity to wipe out the other. 

I know this is very political post but lets face it politics is probably one of the biggest factors of mental health decline in the world at the moment, it reveals human behavior on a macro scale. I think I'm a true doomer at this point, I don't see how the world can possibly get any better now. The internet has only seemed to make people more hateful and stupid instead of what you'd think it'd do by connecting the world.","",""

and now it's even worse. Couple of friends wanted to hang out today, and I was so desperate, that in the moment I told them I'll go, but had to cancel, cause I don't really have expendable funds at all. I can't afford to hang out. My inability to get a job is actually making me spiral even worse. I feel like I can't do anything about it. My anxiety triggers a freeze response and sends me down a depression episode every time I try to do anything about it. My mind is constantly making me feel completely incompetent. I can't communicate any of this to my family or friends. I freeze, and can't say a word. Meanwhile I'm experiencing so much distress and emotional pain, I just barely hold together. My brother, trying to be compassionate, and supportive tells me to do something I like doing, but I'm not good at anything, and I can't imagine a job wherein I wouldn't be miserable. I don't want to worry anyone, but I worry them by avoiding them. It kills any potential for help, but I just can't reach out","","ghosthug (8)"

There is this awkward start of accepting that I want to be someone I'm not, and wanting to take steps to get there, but not wanting to feel like I've overstepping my bounds. I'm really liking using fem pronouns, I feel more like im being seen as who I want to be seen as, but at the same time it feels a bit like lying. As someone still pretty new to exploring all of this and what steps I want to take, I know that im going to ask questions and have problems that ""normal women"" don't experience. What comes with that is the fear that someone is going to see my display in one way, then talk about another, and have them feel like I'm trying to mislead them, and I dont want to do that to someone. I know women, or more experienced trans people, have dealt with far more problems with the way they are treated for their presentation and gender than I have in my past, and I dont want it to come across that I've 'stolen their valor' so to speak. Its this mixed bag between the ambiguity of the internet making me feel much safer exploring how things make me feel, but also making me feel scared that I don't want to confuse or hurt  someone else by doing so. I hope what I'm saying makes some kind of sense.
Im not sure if im looking for advice, or just comfort, maybe a little of both, or maybe I just need to vent this. These are complicated new problems and feelings that Im still learning how to handle.","","ghosthug (10)"
